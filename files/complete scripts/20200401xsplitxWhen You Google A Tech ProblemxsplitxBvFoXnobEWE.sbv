0:00:00.000,0:00:01.140
Wow.

0:00:01.140,0:00:04.000
This is a fantastic background.

0:00:04.000,0:00:06.120
Iâ€” I love this background.

0:00:06.120,0:00:07.820
But I have to change it.

0:00:07.820,0:00:09.260
My wife left me.

0:00:09.260,0:00:11.120
And I need a fresh start.

0:00:11.120,0:00:13.880
But how do I change wallpaper again?

0:00:13.880,0:00:15.300
Time to Google.

0:00:15.300,0:00:21.220
Okay, first result is an ad for
50% off divorce lawyers.

0:00:21.220,0:00:22.560
Very creepy.

0:00:22.560,0:00:24.100
But second result, here we go!

0:00:25.540,0:00:28.180
"Hi, just got back from Matrix Reloaded,"

0:00:28.180,0:00:32.180
"and now I wanna change the default background
to Neo beating up those guys."

0:00:32.180,0:00:33.900
"How do I change it?"

0:00:35.100,0:00:35.960
Ahem.

0:00:35.960,0:00:38.020
"Did you try to change the background?"

0:00:38.040,0:00:40.040
- "I also have this problem."

0:00:40.040,0:00:40.760
"That is all."

0:00:40.760,0:00:43.920
- "I don't have this problem
because I use a powermac!"

0:00:43.920,0:00:45.180
- "Har Har Har!"

0:00:45.180,0:00:47.120
"I didn't read the question?"

0:00:47.120,0:00:49.160
- "Does it work if you start in safe mode?"

0:00:49.160,0:00:51.300
- "Okay, I have your solution."

0:00:51.300,0:00:54.600
"Here's a photobucket link that will expire in 2004."

0:00:54.600,0:00:57.160
- "Hi, the link expired,
what was the solution?"

0:00:57.160,0:00:57.660
Tsk.

0:00:57.880,0:01:01.140
- "Why would you resurrect a solved thread?"

0:01:01.140,0:01:03.840
"I take my job as a moderator on a random"

0:01:03.840,0:01:07.400
"tech website no one has ever heard of very seriously!"

0:01:07.400,0:01:10.260
"Banned and thread locked!"

0:01:10.260,0:01:11.489
Okay, that was my fault,

0:01:11.489,0:01:13.720
I should have specified Windows 10.

0:01:13.720,0:01:14.660
Okay, here we go.

0:01:16.040,0:01:19.060
"Hi, my computer is starting
to smell like burnt wood."

0:01:19.060,0:01:22.000
"I think it's because I had
the same wallpaper for too long."

0:01:22.000,0:01:23.360
"How do I change it?"

0:01:24.420,0:01:27.900
"I don't have this problem because I use an iMac!"

0:01:27.900,0:01:30.880
- "Hello, it's me, friendly but not very helpful Indian."

0:01:30.880,0:01:34.300
"If you cannot change background,
consider updating your drivers."

0:01:34.300,0:01:37.280
"If that doesn't work, consider
buying a new graphics card."

0:01:37.280,0:01:38.080
"Good luck!"

0:01:38.080,0:01:39.100
"All izz well!"

0:01:39.100,0:01:42.900
- "Hello, I can actually teach you how to solve this."

0:01:42.900,0:01:45.240
"But beware, I am a software engineer,"

0:01:45.240,0:01:48.940
"and you are moving into a land
completely without visual help."

0:01:48.940,0:01:54.200
"Through a door to a dimension where
the end user's mind is a complete mystery."

0:01:54.200,0:01:56.080
"You are about to enter..."

0:01:56.080,0:01:57.980

"The tutorial begins as any good tech tutorial should,"

0:02:02.940,0:02:06.060
"With entering your BIOS."

0:02:06.060,0:02:08.740
I have no idea what any of this means

0:02:08.740,0:02:10.800
Pretty sure that's Russian.

0:02:10.800,0:02:14.260
but Visual help, that's a great idea. Let's look for a video!

0:02:14.280,0:02:16.460
"Welcome to my tutorial on how to c-"

0:02:16.460,0:02:18.620
No this decade! thank you!

0:02:18.620,0:02:23.900
"what's up!!! if you want to change the desktop background image. This is the video, for you!"

0:02:24.220,0:02:25.260
Ugh, FINALLY!

0:02:27.620,0:02:29.400
"A lot of us have a computer"

0:02:29.400,0:02:31.520
"and on that computer we have an operating system"

0:02:31.520,0:02:32.500
"and that operating system-"

0:02:32.560,0:02:33.420
GET TO THE POINT

0:02:33.420,0:02:36.400
"-has a Desktop and that desktop has a background image."

0:02:36.400,0:02:38.160
"How do we change the image?"

0:02:38.160,0:02:38.720
Yes, how?

0:02:39.360,0:02:41.000
"That's a good question."

0:02:41.000,0:02:42.960
But first we talk about the history of the background.

0:02:42.960,0:02:45.040
*visible frustration* How long is this video!? ("*Unknown Tech Youtuber speech*")

0:02:45.360,0:02:46.460

0:02:46.460,0:02:47.060

0:02:49.040,0:02:50.700
"And that's why,"

0:02:50.710,0:02:56.070
"Windows 8, while a bad operating system was the Ford Mustang of background providing!"

0:02:56.380,0:02:58.800
"So, how do we change background?-"

0:02:58.800,0:02:59.900
Okay, here we go.

0:02:59.900,0:03:01.740
"I will cover this in part two and much more!"

0:03:01.860,0:03:05.040
Yeah, I should have seen that one coming. I'm so tired of this!

0:03:05.420,0:03:10.560
I- I'm genuinely so desperate. I'm willing to click on Google page two

0:03:11.160,0:03:12.920
Background changing software,

0:03:13.500,0:03:15.700
but which one is the real one??!!???!?!? I...

0:03:16.120,0:03:20.420
*cries for help* I can't... I can't do it!

0:03:20.460,0:03:22.380
I could NEVER be a sniper!

0:03:22.380,0:03:28.420
