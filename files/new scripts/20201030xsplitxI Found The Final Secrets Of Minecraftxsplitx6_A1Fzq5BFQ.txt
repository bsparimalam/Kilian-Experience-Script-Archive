minecraft has created nostalgia for 11
00:02
years
00:03
so by now you'd expect there are no
00:04
secrets left to find but
00:06
one thing has always bothered me when
00:08
not sold minecraft to phil spencer
00:11
he seemingly sold something else his
00:14
fedora
00:15
phil never wears it perhaps he's not a
00:17
gentleman or
00:19
it's lost i don't know my only clue
00:22
is this article from the navy that reads
00:25
there once was a developer named notch
00:27
minecraft
00:28
who was king of the twitter whining
00:30
before they cancelled him these were the
00:32
final words he said
00:34
my fedora is yours for the taking but
00:36
you'll have to find it first
00:38
i left it in well actually i got lazy
00:40
and asked jeb to leave it in
00:42
the dev zone ever since then thousands
00:45
of parental disappointments have
00:47
searched for a hat that will make their
00:49
dreams come true
00:50
yo according to legend if you find the
00:53
fedora
00:54
inside vanilla minecraft jeb will add
00:58
whatever you desire into minecraft
01:00
what will i add parents have told me
01:04
creepers have destroyed their kids bases
01:07
and
01:07
they couldn't get them to stop crying
01:10
which is why i want to double the amount
01:13
of creepers
01:14
to raise tougher kids how do we get to
01:17
the dev zone well the only clue we have
01:20
is this old
01:21
sentence on the minecraft wiki the
01:23
problem is that the sentence is written
01:25
in an ancient language that appears to
01:27
be
01:28
silly nonsense called swedish you might
01:31
think
01:31
only like four people speak swedish
01:34
we'll never solve this
01:35
i have a secret i have kept i am person
01:38
number five the first clue
01:41
reads this question is the hardcore
01:44
seed imagine i am omnipresent
01:47
a gift only in light beautifully drafted
01:50
on a sack of parchment
01:52
hmm omnipresent means exists everywhere
01:56
sounds religious but a better guess
01:59
would be
01:59
telephone salesmen but they are not
02:01
beautifully drafted
02:03
the answer has to be ideas
02:07
they exist everywhere they are beautiful
02:10
on paper and they exist in darkness but
02:14
then they are not a gift wait the
02:16
question is to seed
02:18
the riddle is the answer to uh okay now
02:21
i see it
02:22
the correct translation make believe i'm
02:25
everywhere
02:26
given in the light these are the lyrics
02:28
to a never-ending story
02:29
creates world this place doesn't look
02:33
very special
02:34
except for the chest clue number two
02:37
welcome to the dev zone here we've put
02:40
everything too awesome to be in the main
02:43
game
02:44
children ruin everything we should have
02:46
added boning in beta
02:48
but you're not quite there yet clue two
02:53

02:55
greatest tale ever told
02:57

03:01

03:14
we're going to the devil zone pack your
03:16
own bags you have a clue for me
03:19
travel south 10 miles up the waterfall
03:22
it's probably scandinavian miles so
03:25
that's 100 kilometers
03:27
this is going to take hours and i'm
03:29
going to do it
03:31
but first we'll need to prepare i have
03:33
gathered all the stuff i should need
03:35
it was quite exhausting i prefer playing
03:38
with mods
03:39
but i have to accept that it has to be
03:41
vanilla hardcore
03:42
for this trip it will just be me my gold
03:46
pickaxe
03:47
and my 1985 mazda the donkey
03:50
let's go to the grand dev zone the
03:53
mighty ocean
03:55
is boring you guys are never gonna
03:59
believe this but there are people who
04:00
buy boats unironically
04:02
i have found two waterfalls one of them
04:05
is the entrance
04:06
this one or this one but how will i get
04:10
up there
04:11
in alpha when you entered a waterfall
04:12
with a boat you got blasted up into
04:15
space
04:15
but it was removed and they used the
04:17
argument the game is already fun
04:19
why does it need to be more fun maybe in
04:22
this world
04:24
you know what all versions
04:32
we did it the donkey we made it into
04:36
the dev zone this place is
04:39
unnatural mountains looked like
04:42
mountains it has cubes with rounded
04:46
sides
04:46
this place ain't no roadside picnic
04:49
let's read the next clue
04:51
climb the tallest pillar and get inside
04:54
this clue is written in english it must
04:57
be
04:58
the dev song working its magic wow what
05:00
a fantastic in-video explanation for
05:02
someone being too lazy to come up with
05:04
riddles
05:05
that must be the pillar i'll have to
05:07
climb up there
05:08
but the donkey can't use ladders that's
05:10
fine
05:11
maybe i'll try no this will take too
05:14
long all my subscribers
05:16
know i'm a master of machinations i'll
05:19
have to make
05:20
a horse elevator there let's go with the
05:23
donkey
05:26
and i spent two days making this
05:30
i guess i have to build this kick-ass
05:33
ram
05:34
i'm gonna jump the pillar with my mezda
05:38
pedal to the metal baby ah yeah
05:41
this would be awesome if the windshield
05:44
didn't lock it
05:45
don't worry i'll destroy it yeah where
05:48
did the mazda go
05:50
no my mazda the donkey
05:53
you think my desire has cost me heavily
05:55
but i see this cost
05:57
as an investment in hope okay we are at
06:00
the top
06:01
ah and there's the hole there's the new
06:04
chest
06:05
how are you floating on 50 centimeters
06:07
new clue
06:08
go for a swim in the pool
06:12
i doubt this is the pool i probably need
06:15
to swim on top of a billiard table
06:17
for now let's check out this door this
06:19
appears to be
06:20
some kind of dark and dangerous
06:24
cave something i would never set foot in
06:26
oh
06:27
there's a reception this is actually a
06:29
three star hotel
06:31
something i'm even less likely to set
06:32
foot in now i shall follow the signs to
06:35
the pool area
06:36
there is also the restaurant and the
06:37
fitness center
06:39
i believe those are traps tourist traps
06:42
i brought my own food minecraft has
06:45
llamas so i can eat potatoes pool area
06:48
this way
06:49
ah this is the wrong kind of pool
06:52
and also this is way above olympic
06:54
regulation
06:55
this hotel is just asking for a negative
06:58
review
06:59
beware of monsters the only sea monsters
07:02
in minecraft
07:03
are in the sea and i only see
07:06
squids and there's only one kind of
07:09
squid
07:10
as opposed to all the other animals you
07:12
know unless muyang announces a new squid
07:15
while i'm
07:16
in the dev zone of drew in the entire
07:17
video i do remember one minecon
07:20
a technical director was asked about it
07:22
and he responded
07:23
it can't be contained it can't be
07:26
contained
07:27
dear god help us all never thought much
07:30
about it
07:30
because that's just what programmer
07:32
sounds like when they code
07:34
traveling down in the considering it's a
07:37
hotel pool it's 90
07:39
urine i find a piss covered temple
07:42
the clue has got to be around here
07:44
somewhere you search the right parts i
07:46
search the left part
07:48
after searching through the entire
07:50
temple i've come across what looks like
07:52
a door with a lever to open it
07:55
with a sign that says release the kraken
07:58
this is a quote from a film that decided
08:01
to put a scandinavian sea monster in
08:03
greek mythology
08:05
we are all very upset about that i think
08:08
it's supposed to be
08:09
symbolic pulling this lever is a way to
08:11
say
08:12
that you are willing to betray your home
08:14
to achieve what you desire
08:16
i i have to do it
08:20
or it releases the kraken
08:23
so it's a water monster so i will be
08:25
fine as long as i stay out
08:29
at the correctness up there i can get
08:30
the clue okay the clue is
08:33
what the hell now the clues are in
08:35
swedish again maybe they don't guess a
08:37
quiet place i can't sit down and transit
08:39
what
08:42
kraken the donkey the clue is oh
08:46
that would translate to up i would never
08:48
have you speak swedish
08:50
oh [ __ ] then let's get up to the top of
08:52
the temple the entire
08:54
building is collapsing soon oh [ __ ] soon
08:56
there's no place to hide
08:58
ah we're at the top a new chest a bucket
09:01

09:05

09:18
after all these years i was in high
09:22
school when minecraft came out i spent
09:24
my
09:25
days tricking kids this place existed
09:28
instead of studying
09:29
because i knew i would work as a youtube
09:31
travel guide
09:32
the other much like the iron golems were
09:35
probably inspired by the japanese
09:37
cartoon
09:38
laputa castle in the sky the pewter
09:41
obviously comes from the irish book
09:43
gulliver's travel made famous
09:45
only because of jack black written by
09:48
jonathan
09:48
swift who also wrote the satirical essay
09:51
that said
09:52
english nobles should just eat irish
09:54
children
09:55
this is the only clue i have
09:59
while chasing kids i found the actual
10:01
clue it reads
10:02
don't eat any kids okay but can i really
10:06
trust this paper
10:07
you can really trust this paper well see
10:11

10:50
your back to me
10:51
weakness has no place in the dev zone i
10:54
have to be strong in a hard place so i
10:56
can die weak in a soft place
10:58
the clue is rest in peace rock legend
11:01
damn straight
11:07
as i'm falling i am remembering that
11:10
this puzzle was made in 2014
11:12
could have been another rock a chest
11:16
and a new clue ride the minecart and
11:19
enjoy the view p.s if there's a global
11:22
pandemic when you are here
11:24
this will give you nostalgia what's that
11:26
supposed to mean
11:27
first place your inventory in this
11:30
okay please throw away all liquids sir
11:34
okay i am ready to go the mine cart is
11:38
delayed by 40 minutes
11:40
okay no you don't have time to go
11:42
tax-free shopping now this is why i said
11:44
we should have been here three hours
11:45
early
11:46
ah finally i can't enter
11:49
only mine line gold travelers are
11:51
allowed to board
11:52
how are you a gold traveler finally i'm
11:55
allowed to board let's try this
11:57
and boy was it beautiful for the first
12:00
30 minutes
12:01
then for the next two hours it got kinda
12:03
boring and the only on-board
12:05
entertainment was
12:06
a random season seven episode of suits
12:09
after 12 hours
12:10
i should have paid more to not ride in
12:13
economy
12:13
and my character is dying from hunger
12:16
okay so they finally gave us our food
12:18
it's just called mine cart food not sure
12:21
what's the deal with that oh my god
12:24
finally a stop
12:25
oh it's no i don't want to sign up for
12:27
an exclusive minecart line credit card
12:30
okay that was a fun 14-hour journey and
12:33
now i have to wait again
12:34
for my luggage wait are we we've just
12:37
gone in a circle
12:39
is that i mean that's yours is it just
12:41
hay or
12:42
no i'm not gonna snoop through your
12:44
stuff where's my luggage
12:46

12:49
what the hell is a charlie roy did you
12:52
enjoy your travel no
12:57
lava yes i had a great time
13:00
oh all of that was inside the pillar
13:04
imagine the taxes i guess i'm going down
13:08
it would seem i've been transported
13:10
again well this place is
13:13
nice what an adorable little house
13:16
welcome to the palace of herobrine find
13:19
the clue without
13:20
dying herobrine is something we
13:24
invented to scare kids a lie i spent a
13:27
lot of time to spread
13:29
again did not need good grades was going
13:31
to be a professional starcraft 2 player
13:34
a game that would not die the important
13:36
part of the story is that he's not real
13:38
and this house doesn't seem very scary
13:42
okay when they build these
13:45
spooky infinite hallways with
13:48
fake doors do you think the contractors
13:52
were paid by the meter
13:54
think i see a torch over there this
13:57
leads to a dining hall do you think
14:01
herobrine
14:02
has dinner parties i
14:05
want to have dinner parties but i have
14:08
an excuse
14:10
i only own two chairs are you
14:13
scared the donkey of course not donkeys
14:16
are brutal warriors look it up
14:18
okay this seems like the kind of room a
14:21
clue would be in
14:23
what's that is that him no it's just a
14:26
zombie
14:27
herobrine doesn't exist this is one huge
14:30
hall
14:31
do you see a chest i only see a zombie
14:34
with his
14:35
arms down no no
14:38
no no no no no no no no no no no no no
14:41
no
14:42
no no no no no no no no
14:45
i have an idea all clues have been
14:47
inside chests
14:48
and if they get destroyed the clue
14:50
survives
14:51
and if this part of minecraft truly is
14:54
based on sweden
14:56
it should have a lot of uranium
15:00
so we'll create a brewing stand a
15:01
cauldron enrich some of it and craft yes
15:04
a nuclear weapon
15:06
go go go go go go go go
15:09
no don't stop because
15:12
in a future update they should add shock
15:14
waves see
15:16
this is actually a guide not to build
15:17
the best stone generator
15:19
now to find the clue here congrats on
15:22
learning to not
15:23
judge people based on their looks now
15:27
herobrine will show you where the next
15:29
clue is
15:30
oopsie doopsie next to us gotta be
15:34
around here
15:34
somewhere the donkey i found it
15:37
wow you truly are a parkour master
15:41
unbelievable must have taken you 200
15:43
tries
15:44
yes anyway x marks the final spot
15:48
and the map all right that's a big x
15:51
just a 10 minute ride nice are you ready
15:54
the donkey
15:55
that must be the room that holds the
15:57
fedora
15:59
let us enter this is clearly a trap
16:02
this puzzle was created forever ago when
16:05
traps were more obvious
16:07
ah a polar bear pit oh cliche
16:10
i knew something was wrong when i saw
16:12
the map that's not an x
16:14
it's a cross but i have seen an x this
16:17
donkey seems marked out by a giant
16:19
x i have to go all the way back
16:23
no problem we've come this far eh let's
16:26
travel all the way back
16:28
my nakama on this long journey we'll
16:31
find
16:32
unfathomable danger over here there's a
16:34
hole
16:35
under the x let's head down this must be
16:38
it
16:39
this looks like a proper place to place
16:41
a fedora we have traveled far the donkey
16:44
but soon the fedora will grant us what
16:46
we desire
16:47
what's that you want to show me your
16:50
luggage
16:51
tnt why
16:54
you're going to destroy the fedora so
16:56
that it can't be used by evil men
16:58
no you can't do this the fedoras
17:02
last hope for minecraft well and the
17:05
caves and caverns updates
17:06
you know updates in general are pretty
17:08
liked it's actually impressive they
17:10
haven't destroyed the game
17:11
it's been out for a while and it retains
17:13
what made it special so
17:14
there's actually a lot of hope so yeah
17:16
just go ahead and destroy it
17:18
no wait i'm one of the people who's
17:19
intending to use it for evil i'm taking
17:21
the tnt
17:22
no the donkey no this hunt
17:26
has taken everything from me but at last
17:29
i am here my soul is so broken
17:34
i can't even remember my wish i
17:36
currently only have one desire
17:38
above my own aboveness mighty fedora
17:42
i want you to bring back my close friend
17:46
that i lost
17:49
i ask you now viewers what is minecraft
17:53
is it about creativity and discovering
17:55
worlds
17:56
or is it about the memories you make
17:59
with friends
18:01
because i think maybe just
18:04
maybe minecraft is about 200 horsepower
18:08
dragon air affordable sports cars
18:10
that playboy magazine once named car of
18:13
the year
18:14
you didn't resurrect the donkey killian
18:17
what's up hell no this baby has
18:21
200 horsepower he has zero horsepower
18:25
because he's a donkey also he survived
18:28
and when he saw my mazda he realized
18:31
maybe bad people will use it but it will
18:34
be counteracted
18:35
when the fedora is used by awesome
18:37
people
18:38
so you won't know what he asked for
18:40
there is now a chance just a small
18:42
chance that instead of a village
18:44
spawning the game will instead spawn
18:47
las vegas and everything was awesome
18:51
forever
18:52
and that is killian experience you
19:00
don't give it up for don't keep dreaming
19:02
don't give it up now start dreaming
19:04
don't give it give it up give it up give
19:06
