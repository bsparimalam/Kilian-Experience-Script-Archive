00:00
unnumbered pokemon sequel could this be
00:03
a test by nintendo to see if pokemon
00:06
fans would buy the same game
00:08
two more times because they 100
00:11
wood black 2
00:14
i'm not playing it same places not even
00:18
a new pokemon on the cover
00:20
just an original work don't steal
00:22
pokemon i
00:23
couldn't believe nintendo would ever
00:26
release a low effort pokemon game
00:28
i turned to google for answers and guess
00:31
what i found out
00:32
did you know nintendo is an exclusive
00:35
pokemon game in france
00:37
called pokemon noir i assumed it was
00:40
detective pikachu with alcoholism
00:43
so i bought the sequel and installed an
00:45
english patch
00:47
the game begins with professor golden
00:49
juniper
00:50
that's her name explaining what pokemons
00:52
are her
00:53
field is apparently the origin of
00:55
pokemon
00:56
why do we need a professor for that
00:59
officially
01:00
in the canon they were created by a
01:02
religious creation myth
01:03
you should be a priest pick man or
01:06
woman the boy canonically he
01:10
is a priest named father nathaniel
01:13
not gonna fit the noir theme but the
01:15
girl
01:16
she has head airbags in case her car
01:19
gets hit from the side
01:20
name real name rosa pink
01:24
you can't name a girl pink it's not
01:26
2001.
01:28
to counter this extreme sexism i need to
01:31
start her name by pointing out that she
01:33
has a career
01:34
for example detective and since i'll
01:37
probably fill out the pokedex this time
01:39
her name will be
01:40
detective dexter you wanted to see me
01:43
sir
01:44
are you familiar with the wolfgang case
01:46
i think so
01:48
two years ago a suspicious potato
01:50
salesman killed world
01:51
famous pokemon battle wolfgang the
01:53
potato cellar has now been proven
01:55
innocent because of technology we didn't
01:58
have in 2010
01:59
but now it's 2012 total cyberbunk future
02:03
look at this hologram look at it you
02:06
have a nice hologram sir
02:07
we don't know who killed her but we
02:09
believe a pokemon was involved
02:12
you are my best leaf blade runner i need
02:14
you to catch the killer
02:16
and delete the pokemon i'll do it as
02:18
long as i can voice over monologue
02:21
fine the commissioner wanted me to not
02:24
yet now start by seeking out sharon in
02:27
aspartya city
02:28
we start in one of the new cities
02:30
aspartia
02:31
similar to aspire to be the very best it
02:36
didn't win any game awards because it
02:38
was focusing on literary awards
02:40
you immediately meet your new rival hi
02:43
detective dexter
02:44
i'm officer white too rookie boy scout
02:47
not yet corrupted by the dark world of
02:49
pokemon
02:50
the two of them go off to meet bianca
02:52
who is staring at a totally cyberpunk
02:54
view
02:55
to ask her what she knows about the
02:56
victim i destroyed her tv and should
02:58
never talk to me ever again
03:00
do you want a starter now we get to pick
03:02
our starter not me though
03:05
the department can't afford to give you
03:07
a good pokemon
03:08
so we grabbed whatever we found in
03:10
evidence here's a scraggy
03:12
i want crack sir did he just say
03:15
no that's his pokemon shout please give
03:18
me crack
03:19
sir i don't think there are variations
03:22
there's like
03:23
pikachu and pikapika i know how to make
03:26
it myself if you give me the ingredients
03:28
then we get to battle our rival i don't
03:31
see him grabbing a starter so i guess
03:33
there are just starters roaming around
03:35
i lost wow you are terrible we should
03:38
probably interview the champion next
03:40
you'll need his school bianca also shows
03:43
us the pokemon center and says it'll
03:45
heal our pokemons for free
03:49

05:07
like a cloak

mostly human companion we shall speak at
07:52
a later time
07:53
the sewers officer white 2 is here tells

coldress detective dexter leafblade
08:20
runner
08:21

08:24

08:28
have i met a person that painted itself
08:30
and shouted the same word over and over
08:32

08:33
no but in your position that is a risk
08:36

08:40
spiders carry you up it's disgusting
08:43
gym leader bro that's me i'm detective
08:46
dexter
08:47
i want to ask you some questions alright
08:49
but
08:50

08:52
injured from a bullet through the head
08:54
aren't you a kid i used to be you can't
08:57
be a kid after you find
08:59
siemen in the nidoking's ear please stop

09:06
2011. he
09:08
smiled at me when they carried him away
09:11
take the bat and leave
09:12
now we have to go to wolfgang's hometown
09:14
to investigate
09:16
but we can't cross the bridge after the
09:18
other side was attacked by
09:20
foreign
09:25
we'll go north on our way kolres
09:28
detective
09:29
about pokemon you don't believe they are
09:31
a benefit
09:32
they are walking weapons that can
09:34
understand us we can't understand
09:36
them so you're paranoid i'd say my
09:39
paranoia is healthy
09:40
here used to be the famous new york
09:42
ruins
09:43
now they are real estate like the real
09:46
ones in the new motors tokens defense
09:49
if you didn't want your ancient ruins to
09:51
be demolished
09:52
don't build them near metropolitan area
09:55
a bit for a drop you enter the avenue
09:57
a new feature a guy walks up to you and
09:59
is like
10:00
i've built this massive avenue worth
10:02
millions
10:03
now i'm looking for one lucky stranger
10:06
to take it over
10:07
if someone gives you a business in real
10:09
life that thing has
10:11
loans five times its value out of the
10:13
scam
10:14
end up in nimbasa scraggy what do you
10:17
think about the ferris wheel
10:18
you could sell in there no one would
10:20
overhear
10:22
i'm not so sure about that let's get the
10:25
badge
10:25
the gym is a fashion show this can't
10:28
possibly be legal having an audience
10:30
will affect the performance of the
10:32
pokeman
10:32
also what's the point of fashion pokemon
10:36
characters wear the same thing
10:37
always hello i am melissa i think she
10:41
died
10:42
and you don't look like her identity
10:44
theft never heard of it
10:47

10:49
sounds like a failed borat
10:51
of course i am you know how else would i
10:54
have
10:55
the [ __ ] thank you alessa outside team
10:58
plasma is just standing there
11:00

11:03
one of them
11:03
throws out a trobish that caused a
11:06
pokemon fandom civil war back in 2010
11:10
now they miss this era as i'm walking on
11:13
the bridge i encounter members from the
11:15
same state of matter
11:17
did you not see garbage guide to pokemon
11:20
white
11:21
lord n is weird uh that video was
11:24
actually historically inaccurate he was
11:26
a great and respected pokemon trainer
11:28
hello we are those who left team plasma
11:32
going from militant animal rights
11:34
activists to normal annoying ones
11:37
funded mostly through lord and shovel
11:39
selling empire
11:40
here in tokyo driftwell exists old team
11:43
plasmas hq
11:45
the new team plasma is taken more
11:47
seriously because
11:48
they dress like terrorists but the old
11:51
ones are still taken more seriously in
11:53
bars
11:54
the first thing we need to do in town is
11:56
to meet up with the former accused
11:58
how is life as a free man oh i realized
12:01
that i was in prison because i looked
12:03
suspicious selling potatoes
12:05
now i sell apples you look suspicious
12:08
because you were wearing a suit and
12:09
sunglasses
12:10
like they weren't even actual potatoes
12:12
they were pokemon
12:14
excuse me do you want my last potato
12:16
okay
12:17
ah this kabuto evolves into kabutops
12:20
those aren't blades it's a water pokemon

12:24
are paddles with my new water pokemon
12:26
the rock gym was easy
12:27

12:31
well son i'm from texas i
12:34

12:36
murder absolutely
12:38
i remember a non-brisket smell
12:41

12:44
smoked brisket
12:46
can you please speak to my calling
12:47
instead he gets a call from sharon
12:49
so they head south to the pokemon world
12:51

12:52
which was built by clay that makes it
12:55
private
12:56

12:58
leagues owned by the state
13:00
there's like a lot i want to know
13:02
whatever let's win
13:03
okay then first we need to drug test
13:05
your pokemon
13:07
uh scraggy i have an idea scraggy
13:09
evolves into scrafty
13:11
legalize it man i i guess this
13:14
is an improvement it's magical man
13:17
it's used in hospitals excuse me
13:21
recreational morphine for the people
13:24
as that can't be considered a
13:26
performance-enhancing drug
13:27
i am allowed to compete facing officer
13:30
white
13:31
and gets destroyed by him how are you so
13:33
terrible pokemon
13:35
i used an x accuracy tactic gonna stop
13:37
you right there
13:38
you are supposed to pick an attack that
13:40
has lots of power then spam it
13:42
as the gang walks out a couple of team
13:44
plasma members run past us
13:46
officer white two's please jins tell us
13:48
we should run after them and ask a bunch
13:50
of annoying questions
13:51
even though he was only running because
13:53
he had ordered food and didn't want it
13:55
to get cold
13:56
coldress tells us not to do it go north
13:58
disappear
13:59
anyone with that haircut should not be
14:01
respected they find a boat and are
14:03
surrounded about to be beaten to death
14:06
do not judge a book by its dumb haircut
14:09
time to die
14:11
[Music]
14:13
please ma'am don't smoke he's right
14:16
it takes four minutes of your life
14:18
that's why it's okay
14:20
i'm so young those four minutes are
14:21
further away ah
14:23
no because this is a remodeled oil
14:25
tanker oh
14:26
i see i'm gonna throw the cigarette
14:29
please don't
14:32
i have no idea where i'm supposed to go
14:34
i found this ruin
14:36
perhaps i can find my next pokemon here
14:38
maybe that one
14:39
this is vocarone voc chrome coron
14:43
i hadn't said it out loud with my accent
14:46
ah i had a whole segment planned for
14:48
this i won't say it out loud so i won't
14:51
get demonetized
14:52
this thing will make you cough
14:56
hard no because of the ash it spreads
14:59
ash obviously you see it here in the
15:02
relics
15:03
but there's a theory that it's not real
15:06
oh no
15:07
like it's real but the theory is that it
15:10
was made in a
15:12
made in a lab you see the swoop anna i'm
15:15
getting a girder
15:17
because it evolves into concaldur
15:20
conquildur what is best in life to faint
15:23
to enemies
15:24
get a transport and hear the lamations
15:27
of the lopanis
15:28
turns out i just had to go left and as i
15:31
was walking
15:31
a blue dog appears and it says quabra
15:34
x-plasma tells me his name is cobra lion
15:38
which does sound like someone who would
15:40
say qua bra
15:42
apparently he wants me to solve a
15:44
problem doesn't everyone
15:46
further north we once again visit charge
15:49
stone cave
15:50
in the previous game it was the worst
15:54
this game is a sequel finally out
15:57
and approached by professor juniper
16:00
oopsie i dropped a master ball
16:02
maybe don't investigate the poisoning of
16:04
my ex-husband
16:05
was he killed by a poison type pokemon
16:08
no just normal ratata poison
16:10
then it's no concern to me then meet me
16:13
at the graveyard
16:14
master balboa what does that do catch
16:17
any type of pokemon i better save it
16:19
notice how all the planes are
16:21
transportation planes
16:23
that's because normal planes doesn't
16:25
need to exist because people use
16:27
fly every detail is so thought
16:30
out so don't complain about sword and
16:33
shield because you weren't smart enough
16:35
to get
16:36
it the air gym appears to have been sued
16:39
so now they simply kill anyone who enter
16:41
you can have the badge
16:42
why i'm just in a good mood because
16:46
rona pretty much killed top gun 2. i
16:48
have to ask you a couple of questions
16:50
turn on the fan it would be suicide to
16:53
return
16:54
we are now going to meet juniper at the
16:56
graveyard
16:57
i just have a question are you a patriot
16:59
detective
17:00
i'm sorry we believe narcotics is
17:03
funding team
17:04
plasma we want to send you to mexico
17:06
this operation
17:08
is so off the books it has circumvented
17:11
the earth
17:11
and returned into the books so you
17:13
travel to mexico yes
17:15
the only country with its own theme song
17:18
pokemon mexico is filled with cactuses
17:20
scorpions and ducks with sombreros
17:23
pretty lazy they didn't make a pokemon
17:25
counterpart and just transfer the
17:27
country into the game
17:28
leave the cave and enter other mexico
17:31
tourist mexico
17:32
officer white 2 is here dexter the
17:35
reason i'm fighting team plasma is
17:37
because they stole my sister's purloin
17:39
so i might kill their leader before he
17:41
can reveal any helpful lids
17:42
i'd prefer if you didn't sorry my hate's
17:45
just so strong for some reason
17:47
let us continue north oh it's that guy
17:51
i have a merger investigation and
17:53
terrorist to stop
17:54
i'm i'm gonna ignore him we entered la
17:56
conusa
17:57
apparently these two have been here
17:58
before and could use fly they want you
18:01
to listen to this
18:02
old lady hello young lady let me tell
18:05
you the legend of this town
18:07
long ago here in town i
18:11
old lady unleashed an unspeakable evil
18:14
then a foolish ice dragon created a
18:17
crater
18:18
on to the next town a giant bridge
18:22
a lot of effort was put into this place
18:26
there is literally nothing to do here
18:29
like a city in a certain polish video
18:32
game
18:32
opel town named after the german car
18:35
brand
18:36
people forget when listing german car
18:38
brands
18:39
oh it's her ah welcome to my home
18:42
detective
18:43
i have some questions to ask hmm
18:46
radicals threaten our nation
18:48
yet you follow your strange obsession
18:51
ask away
18:52
how did you know the victim i feared
18:55
and envied the girl her lack of empathy
18:58
and emotion
18:59
made her less human and more machine
19:03
this would be her downfall do you know
19:05
who killed her
19:06
i'd argue this conversation shows she's
19:10
still alive detective
19:11
no she's very much dead okay i have no
19:14
idea actually
19:15
the gym is a giant empty room where you
19:18
ride a robot dragon attacking a
19:21
chinese dragon's fist good thing
19:25
this is the future and they have
19:26
invented artificial gravity
19:28
finally reached the top yeah
19:32
he survived because this is a kids video
19:34
sir
19:35
how did you survive the massacre i have
19:37
a niche after i hit my head just now
19:39
i do remember a long ass story though
19:42
there was once
19:43
as powerful sorted dragon then it split
19:46
into two using ancient dna splitting
19:49
technology
19:50
this man hit his head really hard what
19:52
do you think happens next
19:54
i kinda don't want to say so a flying
19:58
ship with a freezing cannon attacks the
20:01
city
20:02
team plasma's currently their sig sagoon
20:05
tells us we
20:06
seek the ancient dna splitter we will go
20:10
apartment to apartment in this million
20:13
people city
20:14
we just froze making it harder to search
20:17
within years it will be in our hands so
20:21
you poke battle them to make them stop
20:23
ah you stopped us for now but our goal
20:26
is to cover all of unova in ice
20:30
aren't you supposed to rescue pokemon
20:32
they will all die
20:33
exactly if everyone is dead no one can
20:36
hurt pokemon okay
20:38
i can't argue with that the gym leader
20:40
actually had the dna splitter
20:42
and gives it to the player this would be
20:44
dumb
20:45
but because of the premise of the video
20:47
it makes sense
20:48
shot myself in the foot it gets stolen
20:51
by teleporting ninas
20:52
detective i believe i know where the
20:54
terrorists are hiding
20:56
where i am going to tell you when you
20:59
have the last badge
21:00
to get to the last city you have to walk
21:03
through a
21:03
long underwater glass tunnel why
21:07
build this you may ask because there's a
21:09
dude blocking the other way
21:12
so if you want massive infrastructure
21:14
contracts just stand in the way of stuff
21:17
the gym is kinda low budget
21:21
like the last one was the wonder of the
21:24
world this is like a
21:25
nice shopping mall welcome trainer
21:28
what's with the disappointed face
21:30
uh nothing my gym is not jaw-dropping
21:33
enough huh
21:34
notice how there isn't a wall behind me
21:37
the gym gets destroyed after
21:39
every hurricane we can't afford the
21:41
fancy insurance
21:42
premiums it's fine may i ask you
21:45
whatever
21:45
take the badge you're a bit snobby for
21:48
having a cop salary
21:49
did you get the badge i'm actually not
21:51
done i have
21:52
more to say now for the final encounter
21:55
with team plasma
21:56
on route 21 we find plasma's ship
22:00
why is it not parked on the top of a
22:02
mountain or something
22:03
because vegans inconspicuous places
22:06
don't sell beyond slowpoke tail
22:09
how do we get on the bridge is lowered
22:12
i am still not done they don't mean 90
22:15
of these teleporters could be removed
22:18
fit private cabins
22:19
and with higher morale they might
22:21
actually try in pokemon battles
22:23
25th and final confrontation with sig
22:26
sagoon
22:27
he's like this is the legendary pokemon
22:29
cairo ram
22:31
now me and random henchman 56
22:34
will eliminate you he also says the
22:37
longer you live
22:38
the more opportunities for failure which
22:40
sounds like something i would say
22:42
they couldn't win the pokemon battle so
22:44
he asks teleporting ninjas to kill them
22:47
or just escort them off the ship and
22:49
they fly up
22:50
this is what happens when you are over
22:52
reliant on pokemon
22:53
you forget how to stab a [ __ ] sharon is
22:56
here
22:56
i have all the badges i don't care about
22:59
the international terrorists that are
23:00
about to kill us all
23:02
tell me right now about the murder of a
23:04
single girl
23:05
okay i only have one thing to say i told
23:08
her
23:09
jogging with your pokemon is very
23:11
important
23:12
i see two the great chasm to save the
23:15
world
23:16
we're here hey look now they parked on
23:19
top of a mountain they must be getting
23:20
desperate
23:21
enter the boat again and new puzzle i
23:24
actually had no idea what i was supposed
23:26
to do here
23:27
i had to look it up because this
23:29
children's game is too smart for me
23:31
finally let's test confrontation with
23:33
zig zagoon
23:35
i win we can now go up and meet
23:38

23:56
raspberry soda fell on it and i realized

25:55
my fool of a son this was a trap are you
25:58
anne
25:58
i need to ask you about the murder of
26:00
wolfgang ah
26:02
that is a long story do you battle
26:04
pokemon a bit
26:05
here in universe ah then you must be
26:08
familiar
26:09
hahaha this was a trap then he activates
26:12
the ancient dna technology
26:15
it gives blue eyes ball transforming
26:18
cannon but the fact that this is the
26:20
most epic battle put in a pokemon game
26:23
up until this
26:24
point really shows you how starved the
26:26
pokemon fans are
26:27
then genesis fuses
26:31
the two monsters this
26:34
this is a massive rip-off completely
26:37
stolen from the geniuses to create a dub
26:40
digimon season 2
26:42
where the digimon emperor is planning on
26:44
fusing all the old
26:46
main digimon to create sky miramon
26:49
because he's 12 or something and this is
26:50
what the ultimate digimon looks like
26:52
when will the shamelessness stop when
26:56
will people stop stealing completely
26:58
original ideas from superior cartoons
27:02
his name is bazakiram yeah this is the
27:04
ultimate pokemon
27:06
dice in one hit you one hit the ultimate
27:08
pokemon
27:09
yes it's cold so my robot functions
27:12

27:39
iris nosto ask her take on the pokemon
27:43
league
27:43
i do have some good leveled up pokemon
27:46
including my level 100
27:48
concolder victory road sucks
27:51
and all my pokemon are pretty much dead
27:55
halt officer white too i'm sorry
27:58
detective
27:59
but this new revelation means i need to
28:02
kill you
28:02
but first i have to defeat you in a
28:04
pokemon battle fortunately
28:06
you suck what the officer does not know
28:09
is that i have learned the move
28:11
high jump kick and it's pretty much a
28:14
handheld
28:14
nuclear submarine killed all his pokemon
28:17
in one hit
28:18
officer you're under arrest ah
28:22
not gonna happen i'm actually a
28:23
replicant controlled by the killer
28:25
goodbye detective damn this cyberpunk
28:28
future
28:29
he's gone is that the only hologram that
28:32
exists
28:32
pokemon league conquildor smash
28:36
conquildor smash conquildor
28:39
final how did you get rid of the giant
28:42
palace behind the pokemon league seems
28:45
impossible in just two years
28:47
why do mankind assume extraordinary
28:50
things are impossible
28:52
we can create thinking life but the
28:55
walls in our minds
28:57
shows we are still not gods what
29:01
we annexed mexico and made them do it i
29:04
see
29:04
my workers will now allow you to cross
29:06
the bridge and visit wolfgang's hometown
29:09
so i traveled there avoiding everyone so
29:11
i could just get the footage
29:13
of course it's so obvious i've learned a
29:17
lot on this journey
29:18
one thing that i've constantly been told
29:21
is that people
29:22
can survive getting shot through the
29:24
head i believe the killer was
29:26
found by charon taken to the pokemon
29:29
center
29:29
he followed the victim overheard where
29:33
she was supposed to go
29:34
waited for her to cross the bridge saw
29:37
her reach the pokemon league
29:39
and entered the palace before her to get
29:41
revenge
29:42
is this true amber
29:45
amber amber emblem amber amber amber
29:49
amber amber amber
29:52
amber embaramba
29:55
amber amber and bramber amber
29:59
amber amber hambur and baramber
30:03
i had no idea what the pig said perhaps
30:06
it's because i don't speak pokemon
30:08
is perhaps it was because i didn't
30:10
respect him as a villain
30:11
because he was played by a dutch actor
30:14
yeah i planned that
30:15
5d chess and that is the killian
30:18
experience
30:19
