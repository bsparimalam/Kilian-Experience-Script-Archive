00:00
subnautica below zero when you thought
00:03
water couldn't get any scarier they
00:06
turned up the heat
00:07
by turning down the heat hypothermia is
00:10
scarier than drowning
00:11
but it has something even scarier than
00:13
that office politics but it's skippable
00:18
i liked old subnautica even made a video
00:20
on it
00:21
but i have to address perhaps my
00:24
greatest controversy i never cooked the
00:27
leviathan in lemon sauce
00:29
i was getting comments like killian i'm
00:32
a warrior was left for dead
00:34
was gonna go on an epic revenge trail
00:36
then this greater betrayal happened
00:38
i'm sorry man i couldn't transport him
00:41
the developer
00:42
unknown world saw my despair so
00:46
they added a truck and a pre-frozen
00:48
leviathan
00:50
so in this video i'm becoming a trucker
00:52
we will also defreeze the frozen
00:54
leviathan
00:55
use balsamic vinegar to help with the
00:58
frozen meat taste
01:00
then serve it with the smoothest
01:04
lemon sauce i can make the game begins
01:06
with me stealing a random drop pod from
01:09
some random woman who is this
01:11
hi my name is i'm stealing this ship in
01:14
the meteor shower
01:15
your ship will get hit you'll fault your
01:17
death
01:19
sir a fall can't kill you it's the
01:22
ground that kills you
01:23
and this is a water planet also i'm an
01:26
elite pod driver oh
01:28

01:31
what did i say welcome once again to the
01:34
planet even more earth
01:36
before we do anything i'm gonna show you
01:39
how to unlock
01:40
the frozen leviathan quest swim to this
01:43
exposed wire now place your body on it
01:47
and charge up your own blood now you
01:49
will have
01:50
enough electricity inside of you to use
01:52
this computer
01:53
here we need the secret password the
01:56
true
01:57
name of the frozen leviathan it can only
02:00
be
02:00
rachel because female protagonist thus
02:03
female giant monster
02:05
and rachel it's the only girl name i can
02:08
come up with
02:09
like the two sisters in the game are
02:11
called sam
02:12
and robin it's hard to come up with girl
02:15
names
02:16
now you will be moved to the
02:17
microwavable sea monster
02:19
except the cave will be blocked off on
02:21
these beds
02:22
you need to place the four colossi of
02:25
below
02:26
zero hidden mega creatures that we need
02:29
to kill before we can remove the
02:31
ice before you ask no we can't eat them
02:34
i don't have enough lemons
02:36
back to the game step one like the
02:38
previous game is to get the auto tank
02:41
and knife the on-2 tank gives
02:44
30 seconds of oxygen and time moves
02:47
72 times as fast right that means it
02:51
gives
02:52
36 minutes of oxygen in real
02:55
time diving is a very dangerous hobby do
02:58
not bring
02:59
subpar equipment get knife did you know
03:02
the original voice actress for the game
03:04
was british
03:05
but they had to change it because an
03:07
english person constructing a knife
03:09
without a knife constructing license
03:11
was considered very bigoted now that the
03:14
basic equipment is done we can build
03:16
the sea glide the scanner is the only
03:19
way to acquire blueprints
03:21
if they lose the ability to build these
03:23
this entire space-faring society will be
03:26
thrown into a millennia-long dark age
03:29
our underwater spirits are no longer
03:31
sleep inducing
03:32
we almost get our first signal that
03:35
sends us to
03:35
the twisty bridges here we can throw
03:39
away that stupid sea glide
03:41
because there they are the sea truck
03:44
fragments
03:45
our only goal now should be to grab that
03:48
sea glide again
03:50
and also to become underwater truckers
03:53
getting all the materials took a while
03:56
not because they were hard to find
03:58
but because i was listening to the
04:00
finding nemo soundtrack while
04:02
gathering and got sad but now we are
04:06
finally ready unleash the truck
04:11
look at that denim coloring the tasteful
04:13
petite control column
04:15
oh my god it even has attachments i
04:18
shall name my sea truck
04:20
bertha should probably check out that
04:22
signal now we follow these lights and
04:25
come upon
04:26
this cave is a natural formation hello
04:29
is anyone there the name's killian
04:32
please ask me about my job hello kilian
04:35
my name is i am looking to be
04:38
transported in temporary storage
04:41
yes i have that and an erection
04:44
so alan enters your mind you are not
04:47
nervous i am squatting in your neurons
04:50
nah we're on an ice planet aliens
04:53
entering mines driving them to madness
04:56
is a trope
04:56
but i was already driven to madness
04:58
while hunting marcus
05:00
can't be driven to madness again because
05:02
of double jeopardy madness
05:04
you misunderstand i'm good and not
05:06
lovecraftian
05:07
in that way i see wait in that way
05:11
yes let me tell you what i think of the
05:13
irish
05:14
deeper under the twisty bridges we get
05:17
the first
05:17
modules so we can now turn our truck
05:20
into a real truck
05:21
and we've received a second signal let's
05:24
go there and let's
05:25
listen to some tunes for the ride
05:29
they added a jukebox to the game has
05:31
some electric music
05:33
some rap unknown there's a truck in the
05:36
game
05:37
you can't be a real trucker without
05:40
western country kilian please i'm a
05:43
trucker
05:44
and i've never listened to western
05:46
country or this
05:48
johnny cash person you see i belong in a
05:51
fantasy
05:52
novel because i'm a fictional character
05:54
that can't exist
05:56
noted if you think it's because you
05:58
can't make
05:59
underwater country let me just turn
06:02
on the radio
06:06
an old marine went swimming out one dark
06:09
and windy day
06:13
a power ridge he rested as he went along
06:16
his way
06:18
[Music]
06:19
i know let's run some mighty heard of
06:21
red light subsea songs
06:24
some titanium
06:37
you boat slightly above the sea level
06:41
we're here solid land on this island you
06:45
meet a libertarian
06:46
woman that's the second one ever
06:49
she wants to kill me i only have one way
06:52
to defuse the situation
06:54
you government trying to take my
06:56
personal sword-wielding mech
06:58
my name is not government i am killian
07:02
are you employed by the government i am
07:05
employed
07:06
at a job if it scares off indian phone
07:09
scammers it can scare off anyone
07:11
the rest of the island contains a tower
07:13
and the habitat pillar
07:15
to build housing that's i obviously
07:18
won't need because i'm playing a
07:20
trucker build must still scan every
07:22
piece of furniture i see
07:25
i'm sorry it's in my dna well the main
07:28
reason we are on this island is to face
07:30
the first colossal leviathan
07:32
start by going into this cave here's
07:35
another terminal
07:37
as you can see it's already on to go
07:39
ahead we need to know the name of the
07:41
next
07:42
super leviathan i already know it it has
07:45
to be
07:46
marcos spanish marcus like i said it's
07:49
hard coming up with names now you can
07:51
enter these caresses
07:53
to get down all the way down to face
07:56
the first leviathan marcos el crabbo
08:00
how will you kill him kilian i can't
08:02
attack him he'd squish me in one hit
08:05
we'll make poison then we'll mix it into
08:08
the
08:08
thing crabs crave the most pepsi max
08:12
but how will i get him to drink it
08:14
mexican style
08:16
hola don marcos i have a la say pepsico
08:19
mexico
08:20
one down down here you also find
08:24
the mech so i built it and the robot
08:27
rack
08:27
but then it became harder to enter my
08:29
truck so i just dumped it here never to
08:31
be used
08:32
now we can go visit the american lady in
08:35
her house
08:36
but the main quest is actually to
08:38
assemble allen's body
08:40
fun fact about him they haven't shown
08:42
any hints
08:43
he's evil so it'll be interesting to see
08:47
how his evil twist will make sense to
08:49
find body parts
08:50
scan random artifacts the scanner
08:54
makes guesses what these things are is
08:57
probably wrong
08:58
every time like if an alien scanned
09:01
the ruins of a color printer would
09:04
probably think it's an artist's
09:05
rendition of
09:06
greed first body found this place is
09:09
nice alan
09:10
yes it's a urinal we live in water
09:14
so we don't have pools to piss in thus
09:16
we create these places
09:18
now it's time to visit the american
09:20
woman and see what she wanted
09:22
you shouldn't be here i am driving my
09:24
truck without a license
09:26
welcome to my home look it i'm allergic
09:28
to gluten
09:29
and one time i got a gluten-free bagel
09:32
without asking
09:33
that's how i knew the government was
09:35
tracking me so i left earth
09:37
i would do the same then did you see the
09:40
antenna
09:41
the communist feds are using 6g to turn
09:43
the sea monsters into liberals
09:45
stop it to turn off the antenna we need
09:47
to hack it
09:48
this can be done by scanning batteries
09:50
inside crashed ships
09:52
i died four times in this ship killian
09:55
that's because i know why
09:56
i have finished the game now there was a
09:58
bloody oxygen tank extension
10:01
this is the worst game ever made like i
10:03
hate water
10:04
trash liquid the plastic island in our
10:07
oceans is getting ruined by it
10:09
i did it good job kid
10:12
now go on youtube and search for a guide
10:15
now to find me
10:16
i'm not gonna do that i'm gonna find her
10:19
myself
10:20
turn on the western country to the okay
10:23
you're supposed to search for bloody
10:24
island because
10:25
i country squad right yes there is a map
10:28
but
10:28
it didn't help at all
10:31
[Music]
10:40
these lyrics really resonate with me i
10:43
think that's land that's definitely but
10:45
there's a snow storm
10:46
oh my god it was dark before i've been
10:49
searching around this i hate
10:51
myself went on living but instead it
10:53
came to harm
10:54
when he tried to match the hunter with
10:56
the biceps on his
10:58
arm finding this did not take three
11:00
minutes
11:01
i've listened to the same song sixty
11:03
times okay
11:04
the second leviathan is a whale just
11:07
change the game language to japanese
11:09
he'll show up to defend his whale bodies
11:11
language changed and oh there he is
11:14
knife won't do anything against this
11:17
i'll have to
11:18
ram him but this won't be heavy enough
11:22
yes stop it stop that's that was very
11:25
rude
11:25
i have finally achieved the legendary
11:28
super trucker
11:32
oh no i hit a skunk
11:35
you will now spend time on land is it as
11:38
fun as exploring underwater
11:40
hated every second of it my god
11:44
you get a speeder that they
11:46
intentionally made
11:47
not fun also you keep freezing to death
11:51
you can build winter clothes i never did
11:55
it's not in my blood to care about the
11:58
cold
11:58
and developers should have changed it so
12:01
that coal doesn't affect scandinavians
12:03
but but worst of all my truck like why
12:07
add a truck to the game if you can't use
12:09
it 100 of the time
12:11
on this island is a robot lab and the
12:14
frozen leviathan
12:15
here we finally find out
12:18
what's happened to the main character's
12:20
sister i skipped that part
12:22
but but the big mystery was that
12:25
the the sister's death was ruled as an
12:27
accident
12:28
but it might not have been in the cave
12:31
we find out it was actually a righteous
12:35
murder-suicide
12:36
so the evil mega corp apparently
12:40
didn't want her to look bad awfully nice
12:44
mega corp the leviathan has a virus
12:47
there is a hidden cure
12:48
to the virus that can only be accessed
12:50
by a robot penguin
12:52
to find this cure this is the map they
12:55
gave you
12:56
doesn't make sense if you haven't played
12:57
the game doesn't make sense if you have
13:00
watched some youtube tutorials also
13:03
didn't help at all i eventually stumbled
13:05
upon it
13:06
got an achievement got a migraine but
13:08
i've also heard that somewhere around
13:10
here is the third colossus there's even
13:12
a terminal
13:14
there seems to be a cave on the other
13:17
side of the ice
13:18
i should go there so i went there i
13:21
don't
13:21
see anyone oh no hide cumberbatch
13:25
maybe it's like when you have a crush
13:27
just go up and talk to her
13:29
no no no no no no no no no no oh
13:32
no this game has the creepiest out of
13:34
bound protection
13:35
ever created that weren't exactly
13:39
how it goes when i approach a girl i get
13:41
eaten alive
13:42
the problem was it attacked me because i
13:44
am not a penguin
13:45
so i'm going to have to build another
13:47
penguin but this time make it
13:50
15 times its size approach it
13:54
then press the penguin supoku button
13:58
leviathan 3 down on the other side of
14:01
this closed bridge we can find piece 2
14:03
of alan's body
14:05
in a normal killian video i would focus
14:07
on raising the sea level
14:09
but look at these disgusting electricity
14:11
options it seems like you are supposed
14:13
to build hydraulic fluid
14:15
i refuse truckers don't have to follow
14:18
the law
14:19
now we are on the other side here we get
14:21
a thumper
14:22
oh hey a dune reference hello oh
14:25
no there was a tune reference in my last
14:28
video
14:30
i gotta go tell him rahrar we are snow
14:32
worms
14:33
hi yeah no no we've already filled the
14:36
dune quota
14:38
you won't be getting paid excuse me this
14:40
is absolutely ridiculous
14:42
yeah don't wash those clothes because my
14:44
lawyers will own them
14:45
i've been walking around and walking
14:47
around can't find the body part
14:49
but i did find that someone has taken a
14:51
bite out of this ice worm
14:53
lore wise that means this planet has
14:56
some sort of lemon
14:57
finally found the place after using the
15:00
ghost command and searching for green
15:02
this used to be a supervillain slayer
15:04
like how you have
15:05
super villains underwater we had them
15:08
above water
15:09
now i can finally get back to bertha we
15:12
have two things left to do
15:14
slay the final titan and build alan's
15:17
body
15:18
for both of those things we need to go
15:20
to
15:21
the crystal caverns looks nice here we
15:25
go
15:25
a while ago in california like we've
15:28
constructed this crystal cave
15:30
what should people feel like when
15:31
entering object
15:33
horror yes what's like what do you fear
15:36
more than anything
15:37
blue vaginas the crystal cave is no no
15:41
no no no no no no no no no don't trust
15:43
my truck
15:44
you wouldn't win a beauty competition
15:46
against a blobfish
15:48
this area has the final body part or
15:51
should i say
15:52
parts organs alan got your ears on
15:55
no killian you can't sell the organs on
15:57
a black market darn it all
15:59
okay to construct the body we need to
16:01
find an alien constructor
16:03
every single progression point in
16:05
subnautica has been further down
16:08
perhaps i should check further
16:11
down maybe not maybe this place is the
16:14
worst
16:15
oh god oh god final truck stop first we
16:18
need to
16:19
write the final titan's name so it will
16:21
spawn
16:22
in lovecraftian fashion the name is
16:23
impossible to pronounce for mortals
16:25
so i'm just gonna have to write it down
16:27
now let's build alan's body
16:29
if you had built a base you probably
16:31
would have forgotten the materials
16:32
required forcing you to go
16:34
all the way back perhaps quitting the
16:36
game and watching the ending on youtube
16:38
i lack such problems this is when he
16:41
should betray us
16:43
wait alan you're a centaur
16:46
you never were evil you're just greek
16:49
yes now you can hear my real voice i am
16:51
alantros killian come to my spaceship we
16:54
eat souvlaki with drinks
16:56
i want to elantros but i can't i have
16:59
one thing i need to do
17:00
trucking towards the final colossus
17:03
the fact remains that all the titans
17:06
have been
17:06
friendly thus the final colossus must be
17:10
too
17:10
we are unleashing our mad holy fishballs
17:14
i bet you think i'm gonna run away no
17:16
this isn't some fragile
17:18
submarine this is a truck we're making
17:21
shrimp cocktail boys
17:23
how many shrimps do i have to slay
17:25
before they cover my bertha in blood
17:28
shrimps don't have blood the point is
17:32
i'm a flamingo the warrior of the pond
17:35
i i just thought of something his mouth
17:38
is bigger than my entire truck why
17:41
doesn't he just oh no
17:42
bertha now i was trucker man
17:46
oh oh so that's why you build the
17:49
base
17:50
i am back to zero the only thing i have
17:53
left is my exo suit
17:55
i have no way of defeating him i can't
17:58
train because i'll freeze to death
18:00
perhaps i should give up and focus on my
18:02
country career
18:03
wait country music of course
18:07
okay he's under me rodeo time
18:10
yee hall yeehaw
18:14
yeehaw all the colossi
18:17
are dead now i return to the frozen
18:20
leviathan
18:22
and place the statues i picked up on the
18:24
beds that have changed places don't
18:26
think about it
18:27
did you hear that the ice has melted
18:30
now to chop it up but how do i make a
18:33
smooth
18:33
lemon sauce hi there killian to make a
18:36
lemon sauce smooth
18:38
you do it the same way you make hair
18:40
smooth
18:41
cheap conditioner just drench the lemons
18:45
then the acids will melt down the melons
18:47
into the smoothest
