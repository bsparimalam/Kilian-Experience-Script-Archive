00:00
sponsored link in the description months
00:02
ago i got an email about a game called
00:05
humankind would you be interested in an
00:08
historical strategy game from the makers
00:11
of big mommy lizard game no what if i
00:14
told you it's published by the same
00:16
publisher as black gun rodent
00:19
i'm officially ride or die for humankind
00:23
a couple of months later the hedgehog
00:25
people reached out and said would you do
00:27
a sponsored video for this game uh
00:30
absolutely i i had never heard of this
00:33
before please give me money so here is a
00:36
humankind video with a little bit of an
00:38
improvised field with the close deadline
00:41
i had to highlight a french video game
00:44
for the upcoming history of film video
00:47
that has the folder name bullying the
00:49
french there is very little film history
00:51
in the bullying the french video i had
00:53
been looking forward to playing the game
00:55
but there was one big problem with it
00:58
humankind
01:00
i don't want to play as humans trash
01:02
species in the game you can swallow
01:05
cities into your main city some thinking
01:08
will play as some sort of hive mind
01:10
creature that swallows the entire map of
01:13
a future killian here yeah this plan did
01:16
not work out at all i had been playing
01:18
on quick where it was possible uh but i
01:21
played on standard this time and it
01:23
destroyed my dream pretty weird i'm
01:25
adding future killian in the recording
01:27
as it was only in the document the
01:29
recording isn't later so i had to do
01:32
this voice my goal with today's game is
01:34
simple animal only creates some sort of
01:37
animal swarm that will swarm the filthy
01:40
humans and eat their delicious livers
01:42
let us commence fourth first create our
01:44
character he needs to be an historical
01:47
character so we have to give him a
01:49
syphilis i mean a wig
01:52
that's why they wore bit wigs back in
01:54
the day or maybe kings just randomly
01:57
found them fashionable map
01:59
one continent only it would look
02:01
disgusting if our sprawling world tumor
02:04
like had a small region on the other
02:06
side of the map difficulty
02:09
hamilto
02:10
town
02:11
metro nation empire
02:17
what a clever way to get a contract
02:19
bridge obviously we're playing on
02:22
humankind
02:24
look at look at how my character is
02:26
smiling ignore the point focus on the
02:28
character humankind invent the tools
02:32
then only did like four more things of
02:34
value mostly in the 80s
02:36
kilian this game seems kinda similar to
02:42
you know i actually don't know what you
02:45
were talking about i am contractually
02:48
obligated to not know what you were
02:49
referring to at the start you get to
02:51
pick your first
02:52
[Music]
02:54
culture you get a new one every epoch
02:56
the first one we are picking are the
02:59
egyptians because they get industry so
03:02
we can produce a swarm and also because
03:04
they had animal gods okay
03:07
egypt has been taken cool cool
03:10
then we shall pick restart the game i'll
03:13
be a son of a croc the egyptians are
03:15
free now humankind is a forks game that
03:18
means you gather four resources then you
03:21
click next turn repeat food cash
03:24
industry science and hours lost now then
03:27
how to gather each resource food in real
03:30
life it comes from i don't know actually
03:33
i live in the city in the game this corn
03:36
symbol increases it you get industry
03:38
from building pyramids make sense
03:41
imagine not being a slave because the
03:43
pyramids were built by farmers paid in
03:45
beer imagine dragging those rocks
03:47
thinking my great great grandson is
03:50
gonna scam some tourists here in 4 000
03:52
years you would be able to do anything
03:55
gold you get by meeting other countries
03:58
and they will buy your luxury resources
04:00
obviously the point of the video was to
04:02
reject humans because we are playing as
04:04
some sort of undecided swarm but
04:06
remember the first point of the video
04:08
that it was sponsored so you know gotta
04:10
make money there's also influence and
04:12
civics that affects the politics of our
04:14
country for example our creation myth
04:16
the problem is that we know exactly how
04:19
we were created by a bunch of frenchmen
04:22
as we are rejecting our humanity we must
04:24
reject our gods if you do everything
04:26
right you will rather immediately enter
04:28
the classical era yes mozart which
04:32
ancient culture to choose
04:34
going with the maya because they
04:37
predicted a doom and i predict this game
04:39
will end in a doom we just gotta wonder
04:42
wonders are these things that take one
04:44
turn to build because of my high
04:46
industry and i get all the bonuses
04:48
making me even more op i'm picking the
04:51
colossus of rhodos watching the video
04:53
back i realized it's the worst wonder
04:56
available and i say that with pride even
04:59
in a sponsored video i am dedicated to
05:02
being bad at video games now let's talk
05:04
on controversial topics like religion a
05:07
big problem with religion is the fact
05:10
that there are other religions so when
05:12
we create our religion we shall name it
05:14
the not heretic religion meaning you
05:17
can't call us heretics it's in the name
05:19
another problem is that i'm being
05:21
invaded by horse chariots but they
05:23
aren't attacking me this is called sigma
05:26
energy don't destroy me stonehenge
05:28
that's me religion thing the only
05:30
non-human units i have so far are
05:33
chariots
05:34
ignore the
05:36
can't build them because i lack copper
05:38
can't trade it because all my neighbors
05:41
have barely developed fire yet so i need
05:43
to build an outpost in the middle of
05:44
nowhere ruining the entire point of the
05:46
map to take out my enemies and after all
05:49
that work my enemies collapsed on
05:51
themselves
05:52
screw this era the medieval era i made a
05:55
promise not to bully the french in this
05:57
video but then there's this the english
05:59
picture is origin vote for you and the
06:01
french picture is this regal and mighty
06:03
king they are still mad 1 000 years
06:07
later about the longbows i'll keep on
06:09
playing industry only by playing the
06:11
khmer and now i officially have a plan
06:14
my original plan was to absorb every
06:17
city into my main city
06:20
creating a city of
06:22
large proportions
06:24
some would perhaps even call it
06:26
mega proportions then i had a new idea
06:30
elephants our non-human swarm will be
06:33
elephants only the medieval era was a
06:35
boring time then they invented the cork
06:37
increasing the alcohol content in wine
06:39
turning it into a great time too bad the
06:42
argument between the paleontologists and
06:44
the archaeologists is making them hide
06:46
the dragon bones playing as a swarm i
06:49
should name the capital into the swarm
06:53
thebes into
06:54
thieby says plural and tick all into
06:59
tickle because like it swarms if a swarm
07:03
goes over you it tickles right now my
07:05
biggest problem is stability if it goes
07:08
too low my army of six horses has to
07:11
take on a full scale rebellion the way
07:13
to race it is either garry garrisons or
07:16
fun quarters genius idea we'll place
07:19
them next to each other that way fun is
07:22
government mandated okay
07:24
eight turns away from my first elephants
07:27
but before i get them i get to early
07:29
modern era we are picking the mughal
07:31
empire to keep up with our industry
07:33
focus and yes the elephants with cannons
07:36
the fact that amplitude gave elephants
07:38
as every special unit for every industry
07:40
culture makes them god damn heroes early
07:43
modern era made famous by pirates and
07:45
mozart no you can't place either of them
07:48
at least you can get the winged czars i
07:50
have forgotten to talk about buildings
07:52
as you research you get buildings that
07:54
improves your city the reason i forgot
07:56
about them is that with 2 000 industry i
07:59
build all of them in one turn you know
08:01
what else i build in one turn an entire
08:03
swarm of canon elephants rename all our
08:07
cities trample our neighbors it's time
08:10
for you to d oh i have to raise the war
08:13
score to invade them
08:15
i demand you stop being heretic convert
08:17
to ganeshan monotheism now we wait
08:22
no
08:23
we gotta go to war before we reach
08:25
industrial era
08:27
we have to acknowledge
08:29
that the mexican culture has food
08:31
bonuses and the french one has no food
08:34
bonuses
08:36
i think that's le tresen we are of
08:38
course picking siam the culture with
08:40
elephants and gatling guns ah the
08:42
industrial revolution everyone gets
08:44
tuberculosis and if you're not getting
08:46
it you're getting shot by guns that can
08:48
shoot bullets faster than ever also
08:50
candy stores show up in every city so
08:52
the consequences weren't a complete
08:53
disaster for mankind pick a new wonder
08:55
big ben gives science shouldn't it give
08:58
productivity because it tells people
09:00
it's like three bongs in the morning you
09:03
should go to sleep what were we doing in
09:05
the previous era oh right i'm taking
09:08
poland here i would like to talk about
09:10
combat but i'm not sure how combat works
09:13
as these people with meat cleavers
09:15
aren't immune to my cannonballs now i
09:17
have three new cities yay yay this is
09:19
the city i really wanted because it has
09:22
black gold playing as siam i can't just
09:25
declare it in the need of freedom or
09:27
maybe spicy food but playing as an
09:29
elephant country i can't stomp it well
09:32
what are the dutch gonna do yeah i know
09:34
the dutch are tall but very few of them
09:36
are taller than elephants wait i'm
09:38
fighting over oil doesn't that make it
09:40
now i like how they gotta create a war
09:43
culture the obvious choice are the yanks
09:46
but that's not really a chill thing to
09:48
do then they remember this fella clever
09:51
i guess i'm picking a science culture
09:55
japan or
09:57
never heard of i could pick swindon for
10:00
the memes but japan are more likely to
10:03
have robot elephants no there's
10:06
pollution
10:07
humans we need to come together to solve
10:10
this i don't think they can so instead
10:12
i'm destroying the world we are japan
10:15
there's a famous japanese comic series
10:17
with a very questionable ending where
10:19
giants walk across the earth so it's
10:21
only fitting that we do it with my brand
10:23
new gatling elephants and just as we are
10:26
about to walk the game ends consistently
10:29
i get consistently blue balled by
10:31
humankind i know what i said
10:33
congratulations your city won that one
10:36
war and you managed to build a wonder
10:39
and 50 more also the planet wasn't
10:42
destroyed good job piss off narrator the
10:45
plan's getting destroyed the wars didn't
10:47
go equally well this time kinda even
10:50
lost this one
10:52
i'm just gonna have to accept the facts
10:54
that elephants can't rule the world but
10:57
there is something more powerful than a
10:59
simple sapient or whatever elephants are
11:01
called in latin be right back
11:03
elephantide educational channel there is
11:06
a species without a latin name called
11:09
thermonuclear missiles yes this is
11:12
officially a country full of thermal
11:14
nuclear missiles only with 15 000
11:16
industry it took me five turns to finish
11:18
the entire nuclear weapons program and
11:20
almost 10 turns to get 60 thermos if you
11:22
feel bad the plant has been so destroyed
11:25
by pollution all their cities are
11:27
rebelling mine aren't because of the
11:29
enforced fun nuclear launch in three two
11:32
one it's royalty-free returning to
11:35
nothing and it's coming down down down
11:37
tumbling down now the land destroyed
11:40
humankind ascended you can buy the game
11:43
using the link in the description it's a
11:45
fun time
11:47
[Music]
11:57
you
