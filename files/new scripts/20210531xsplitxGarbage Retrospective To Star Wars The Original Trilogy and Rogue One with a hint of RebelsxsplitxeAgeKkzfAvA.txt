00:00
people actually doubted the idea of
00:02
putting cowboys and samurais in space
00:05
like of course it would spawn 9 action
00:07
adventure films
00:09
and 2 parodies
00:12
i did a video on the prequels a year ago
00:14
now
00:15
the original trilogy often considered
00:17
better than the prequels
00:19
because they are better than the
00:20
prequels but how did all of this
00:23
actually start there was once a story
00:26
about a boy on a desert planet
00:28
and a dark lord with magical powers and
00:31
music
00:32
by john williams it was called dunya
00:35
kritaranadam
00:36
also known as turkish star wars
00:39
a long time ago in the most mediocre u.s
00:43
state
00:44
fox went to a man named george lucas and
00:46
said here's
00:47
money alright hey alex samurai is in
00:50
space here's my
00:51
i'd love to be in this fairytale rubbish
00:53
for money no way this will completely
00:55
change my legacy
00:56
so they went out in the desert and
00:58
experienced pure
01:00
idol but it came out all right then john
01:03
williams showed up and it turned into a
01:04
masterpiece
01:05
they showed it to the fox board of
01:07
directors half of them fell asleep
01:09
they knew this would be a complete flop
01:13
now 44 years later we know they were
01:16
absolutely right
01:17
though i have found this hidden gem and
01:19
i thought i'd share it with you
01:21
but first even though this is a
01:23
completely forgotten film
01:25
it did still spawn an animated spin-off
01:28
of an animated spin-off of a cash crab
01:31
based on long animated commercials based
01:33
on a yoda quote in the second prequel
01:36
star wars rebels rebels was made purely
01:39
to answer the most important lore
01:41
question of the series
01:42
in an episode he is in an imperial
01:45
academy
01:46
and kids speak with american accents
01:48
that means
01:49
imperial officers do take classes on
01:52
becoming british
01:53
it also works as a starting point for me
01:55
to tell you the entire backstory of star
01:57
wars
01:58
so there was once this republic so
01:59
corrupt its own constitution was in
02:01
offshore bank accounts
02:02
then peppa palpatine was like call me
02:05
greece monkey for we are oiling this
02:06
machine
02:07
there was also a religious order whose
02:09
thing was to kidnap
02:11
children when they saw papa palpi they
02:13
thought
02:14
oh no he might take our religious right
02:17
so they make an attempt on his life
02:18
their rebellion gets spoiled by pod
02:20
racing champion darth vader
02:22
and his majesty's resolve grew ever
02:25
stronger
02:26
so we found the first galactic empire
02:30
sadly humanity's greatness will always
02:32
be held back by the men who microwave
02:35
fish rebels consisting of a bunch of men
02:37
and women and aliens started a war
02:39
against a bunch of british dudes and
02:41
one alien but he's like a really good
02:43
alien
02:44
worth like three aliens even though he
02:47
was so good
02:47
the rebels still got a victory star wars
02:50
no opening crawl put this [ __ ] in
02:53
legends a lot of people consider rogue
02:55
one to be the best
02:56
star wars disney film because it has
03:00
the scene a scene so good i don't have
03:03
to specify which scene
03:04
it's an entire film about fixing a
03:06
mistake that did not exist
03:09
why did they not exhaust port think
03:11
about it
03:12
you had flash installed even though you
03:15
knew it could crash your computer and
03:17
kill your dog
03:18
you debating whether or not to install
03:20
flash did not need a movie
03:22
the film starts with commander krennic
03:25
finding mads mikkelsen
03:26
you see he's jealous because he's a
03:29
pretty solid villain actor but matt
03:31
smickelson
03:32
is a legendary villain actor also
03:34
something about a space station
03:36
a good guy really a man of your talents
03:39
cronic says if you come quietly it'll be
03:42
like an all-inclusive vacation on the
03:44
empire's dime no alcohol
03:45
mad's wife a city tourist decides to
03:48
kill krennic
03:49
assuming these stormtroopers will miss
03:52
these are dark troopers that adorable
03:54
little girl's name is june erso
03:57
i bet you're already immediately
03:58
attached to her but don't worry
04:00
nothing bad will happen to her this is
04:02
star wars she gets rescued by saul
04:05
guerrera
04:05
who in the star wars canon is someone
04:08
the force used
04:09
as a stress ball 13 years later we get
04:11
introduced to the other main character
04:13
intelligence officer cassian
04:15
andor that's pretty weird if a character
04:17
is good and he's an intelligence officer
04:19
it's called a spy oh
04:20
he's an [ __ ] who rescues jin erso and
04:23
takes her to the rebels
04:25
hi jin we are chill rebels you know
04:28
from nostalgia but they've created
04:30
modern rebels
04:32
who mirror our modern geopolitical view
04:34
of them i'm saying they're crazy
04:35
and they have a hostage who's claiming
04:37
the emperor is like
04:38
he's building 2 000 planet destroying
04:41
he's building a giant ball to sell lego
04:44
now go meet forrest whitaker meanwhile
04:46
over at team empire
04:48
this is uncanny tarkin he looks like
04:51
this because the animators got nervous
04:53
by his gaze
04:54
chronic if the senate finds out about
04:57
the death star we might have to
04:58
assassinate a lot of people
05:00
i thought he ordered do not start the
05:02
heroes arrive at jeddah
05:04
to search for the strong independent
05:06
rebels who don't need no sanity they get
05:08
captured and rescued by hip man
05:10
who can see through the force and is
05:12
insanely religious about it
05:14
really if you join the religion and it
05:16
cures your blindness
05:18
you would be super loyal to its scary
05:20
chaotic god
05:21
that killed god needs jin to torture saw
05:23
some more you did a terrible job racing
05:26
me
05:26
i'm a terrorist leader you make an
05:28
excellent point can i see the message my
05:30
father left
05:31
sure hello
05:38
at that exact moment jedi gets destroyed
05:40
in a mining accident
05:42
excellent job krennic though the
05:44
explosion being in slow motion
05:45
seems like a weapon design flaw it's for
05:48
cinematic effect
05:49
i shall take over now you stand here on
05:52
my achievement
05:54
star wars fans like you but we do not
05:56
grant you the title of iconic villain
05:57
what kind of idiot isn't loyal to tarkin
06:00
if tarkin took my achievement i would be
06:02
like yes of course sir
06:03
you are brilliant sir as no one could
06:05
understand the message they decide to
06:07
grab matt smigelson himself
06:09
to get him in front of a danish
06:11
translator krennic arrives first and
06:13
gathers all
06:14
five of the engineers that were
06:16
apparently required to build a moon
06:18
sized battle station
06:19
hi guys who is the rebel yay i have no
06:21
idea what you just said but we don't
06:23
have to pay any of you last month's
06:24
salary if you're all dead
06:26
pew pew pew pew oh well i guess we'll go
06:28
back to the rebels
06:29
granny goes to lava planet hi lord veda
06:32
matt miegelson is dead
06:34
damn it his brother is my closest friend
06:37
this can get awkward also the death star
06:39
is at maximum
06:40
i don't care about that what about my
06:42
thing yes lord vader all the floors are
06:45
perfectly leveled no
06:46
not a single elevated spot will you
06:48
choke me if i ah
06:51
don't choke on your aspirations director
06:53
did i just make a dad joke did padme
06:56
ah although i have a lot to think about
06:59
on the rebel base
07:01
let's go to the planet's scarif and get
07:03
the death star plans
07:04
gin the rebellion has maybe five ships
07:07
all inferior to every imperial ship our
07:10
current plan
07:11
is for the empire to collapse then we'll
07:13
cease power in 500 years what you people
07:16
don't understand
07:17
is that rebellions are built on suicidal
07:20
fanatics
07:21
the main characters are all kinds of
07:23
suicidal so they decide to travel to
07:24
scarif and steal the plans
07:26
scarif sounds like a bond villain but
07:28
it's like a paradise island
07:30
we shall build a military base here on
07:33
this beach
07:33
and then the empire's tax money will
07:35
just have to fund nearby beach houses
07:38
rebels arrive tarkin finds out
07:40
immediately because he's tarkin
07:42
his starking senses could sense if
07:44
someone sneezed incompetently on the
07:45
other side of the galaxy
07:47
the rebel side one admiral apparently
07:49
had psychic power
07:51
and decided to help them out before they
07:54
found
07:54
out about it thanks to the help of
07:56
eastfleet they are now trapped
07:57
guaranteed to die
07:58
they have the death tsar plans though
08:00
robots suggest they send the death star
08:03
plan via satellite wi-fi
08:05
first destroy shield the force is with
08:07
me the force is with me
08:09
screw this he did it and he died
08:12
back in the server room felix no jinn
08:15
has made it to the top
08:17
but just as she's about to send the
08:18
plans i have a gun pointed at you
08:21
well let me spill everything perhaps
08:24
ruining every chance for the rebellion
08:25
then krennic gets killed
08:27
by none other than the actual creator of
08:29
the death star
08:30
[Music]
08:32
they did it the rebels won uh oh
08:36
every single new character from this
08:38
film died which is
08:40
sad followed by extreme happiness
08:42
because now the scene happens
08:44
yeah yeah yeah you know with a film
08:47
where every character dies you wouldn't
08:50
expect to leave with a giant smile
08:52
so i have to congratulate disney on that
08:54
who is that
08:56
is she from star wars subtitle added
08:59
later
09:00
the rebels just won their first victory
09:02
and now they want to blow up the evil
09:05
empire superweapon
09:06
that will bring peace to the galaxy but
09:09
there wasn't peace before the super
09:11
super weapon
09:12
following this we get the iconic scene
09:14
of a triangle attacking a syringe
09:17
the rebels have stolen plans to a space
09:19
station
09:20
this is princess leia daughter of
09:22
senator organa
09:24
so why is she a princess we never find
09:27
out because
09:28
all alderaan records disappeared for
09:30
some reason
09:31
the ship gets bordered by a villain so
09:33
iconic he comes up when you google
09:35
villain
09:36
where are the plans don't wait with your
09:39
heavy breathing you seem to have a
09:41
deceased that actually wouldn't date the
09:42
video
09:43
leia hides the plans inside comedic
09:45
relief and sends them off
09:47
then the empire captures her i'm just on
09:50
a diplomatic mission from the senate to
09:52
aldron
09:53
listen kiddo two things will be
09:55
dissolved tomorrow
09:56
the cemetery the droids land on tatooine
09:59
here we find out what makes star wars
10:02
special
10:03
this skeleton has a backstory of 17
10:06
generations of lores like
10:07
four different serials and new modern
10:10
lore after disney takeover
10:12
droids also get themselves captured now
10:14
we meet the main character of the series
10:17
lucas skywalker he's a bored farm boy
10:20
looking for excitement in most modern
10:23
stories he would witness
10:24
war and realize he had it good on the
10:27
farm in this story he'll realize war is
10:30
quite pleasant
10:30
they are looking for cheap droids to
10:32
help on the farm
10:34
they have to buy them stolen otherwise
10:36
they could have afforded
10:37
humans hey didn't you used to work here
10:40
give me an oil bath while tell the kids
10:43
everything they also get
10:44
r2d2 because the superior droid has a
10:47
bad
10:48
motivator what motivator do the droids
10:51
in star wars have an
10:53
internal life coach later luke is
10:56
playing with r2d2 and discovers a
10:58
message
10:59
who is she she's beautiful why do i want
11:02
to see her stuck in a washing machine
11:04
luke deduces that this obi-wan kenobi
11:07
could be ben kenobi he didn't change his
11:10
surname
11:10
he's he's monster kenobi that's the word
11:13
he asks his uncle to tell him about him
11:15
i have never heard of this obi-wan but
11:17
also he died like your father
11:19
later that night r2d2 runs away luke
11:22
goes after him and is attacked by
11:24
sand people an offensive term for the
11:27
indigenous people
11:28

12:22
six
12:22
jedi yeah she did that [ __ ] but she's my
12:25
crew you know

12:28
warrior that names himself
12:30
cody i'll see your father killed a bunch
12:32
of kids my father he was a good friend
12:35

12:56
in my house
12:57
oh look i've decided to train you in the
13:00
ways of the jedi
13:01
an important rule is to never form any
13:03
romantic relationships
13:04
now let's go rescue your new platonic
13:07
body
13:08
meanwhile the emperor has disbanded the
13:11
imperial senate
13:12
if i hear a single joke about the senate
13:14
expanding itself
13:15
you will be taped in front of the death
13:17
star laser this station no
13:19
this is conan antonio motti his wife
13:23
told him to be more confrontational
13:25
lord vader i read fish makes you smart
13:28
so you must have grown up on a desert
13:30
planet
13:30
please respect the boss on tatooine
13:33
obi-wan and luke has arrived at a bar
13:35
what the hell was that luke that was
13:37
rude as [ __ ] and someone notices
13:40
obi thinking luke is about to be sold
13:42
death sticks tells the seller to rethink
13:44
his life
13:45
chewbacca tells alec there's a guy in
13:48
the bar that hates star wars more than
13:50
he does
13:51
han solo i have the same voice as the
13:53
pokemon video you're looking for a ship
13:55
perhaps this is the fast ship you've
13:57
never heard of the millennium falcon
13:59
it's the most famous ship in human
14:01
culture [ __ ] the enterprise
14:02
oh no the bounty hunter greed has shown
14:05
up
14:06
oh no he shot hanum provoked oh no he's
14:09
gonna shoot him again
14:12
greedo please stop oh no greed has
14:15
become the dictator of north koriban
14:22
finally han shoots him in self-defense
14:25
if han had shot first i i would have
14:27
hated him they managed to escape
14:29
tatooine and jump to light speed
14:32
wouldn't it take decades traveling
14:33
anywhere at light speed kilian
14:36
uh this isn't our galaxy smooth brain
14:39
there's no evidence they have the same
14:41
light speed as us
14:42
on small moon grand moff tarkin you
14:45
smell like
14:46
dog [ __ ] at least i have a smell unlike
14:49
your planet
14:49
you may fire when ready boom back at the
14:53
millennium
14:53
they are entering a brand new asteroid
14:56
field
14:57
with floating organic frozen blood bough
15:01
no they also come across a small moon
15:05
that snow moon that's a dwarf planet
15:08
you see for it to be a natural satellite
15:10
they all agree they should get over this
15:12
rebellion thing and just start new lives
15:14
in belize
15:15
sadly they are causing a tractor beam my
15:18
first thought when seeing the death star
15:20
is
15:21
the officer lounge must be fantastic
15:24
you'd think there'd be thousands of
15:26
ships arriving to aldran
15:28
but i guess traitors don't have tourism
15:31
sectors
15:32
they trick some stormtroopers by
15:33
shooting them no
15:35
hole in their armors say what you want
15:37
about the empire they make some robust
15:39
gear
15:40
also han shoots first they decide to
15:42
split up
15:43
obi is going to turn off the tractor
15:45
beam and the rest are just
15:46
not going to die r2 finds out leia is on
15:50
the station
15:51
so this is why a senator daughter is
15:53
called a princess
15:54
because people will be more likely to
15:56
rescue you they take chewie to the
15:58
prison block and the guards get very
16:00
suspicious because he wasn't notified
16:02
this destroys my suspension of disbelief
16:06
this is still the military things never
16:09
go right
16:10
ever there's no way he would be
16:12
suspicious
16:13
first thing leia says when she sees luke
16:16
is asking him about his height
16:18
women we get a sin showing that vader
16:21
and tarking are bros
16:22
probably go to barbecues and [ __ ]
16:26
he's old and dead you my friend it's all
16:29
that's left of their religion
16:31
well me ahsoka esra that orange-haired
16:35
yoda maul probably faked his death again
16:38
you know
16:38
yellow proof works in the cafeteria
16:40
can't fire him hairnets
16:41
grand moff a legendary actor just said
16:44
something snarky to us
16:46
obi-wan now we get to see what we've
16:48
been waiting four films for
16:50
annie and obi meet everyone
16:56
pretty sure i left you you are weak you
16:59
underestimate the power of the spirit
17:02
level two high ground rituals
17:05
they battle and they are old the final
17:08
thing ob
17:08
sees are the babies reunited again
17:12
then he dies hoping this dumb sci-fi
17:14
movie doesn't define his entire career
17:17
they are not out yet
17:18
chased by thai fighters luke shoots them
17:20
and missed
17:21
several shots like the first time rey
17:24
got behind the gun
17:26
she destroyed three tie fighters in one
17:28
shot
17:29
this is yavin 4. leia has tricked the
17:31
empire into dragging their space station
17:34
to this moon
17:35
now it's a race against time will they
17:37
find a weakness they immediately find it
17:40
universal's plans were completely
17:41
useless to us but a while ago we found
17:44
out one of the imperial computers had
17:46
installed flash
17:47
thanks to hacking you can now shoot
17:48
missiles into this two meter wide hole
17:51
and the base explodes that's impossible
17:54
the metric system was invented in france
17:56
in the 1700s
17:57
it's not impossible it could be like
17:59
tolkien it's a fictional language
18:01
translated
18:02
han is leaving home come die for the
18:04
cause
18:05
if you die you don't have to pay any
18:07
debts miss out on boba
18:08
no thanks kid it's time for the final
18:11
attack on the death star
18:13
all the teams are here fighting a space
18:15
station that only has like
18:16
nine small ships an aircraft carrier has
18:20
80 planes
18:21
they will make three runs for it first
18:23
some bombers
18:24
charge the hole a new ship has entered
18:26
combat he's spinning
18:28
that's a good trick then some x-wing
18:31
charge and
18:31
misses seriously it's no bigger than a
18:34
one brat
18:35
losers the final three charge two of
18:39
them get taken out
18:40
but only luke left he hears the voice of
18:43
obi-wan
18:44
luke the force decides all outcomes
18:47
and that makes the force george lucas
18:50
used to look as luke
18:51
just as vader is about to shoot him how
18:54
did han get here before
18:56
did he make the castle run in less than
18:58
6 parsecs
18:59
luke fires the proton missiles and boom
19:02
it's over
19:03
the end it ends with an award ceremony
19:06
why doesn't chewy get a medal this is
19:09
the most important problem
19:10
in star wars i demand they solve it in
19:14
star wars the empire sort of strikes
19:17
back
19:17
not at all a strike on the same scale
19:20
but like
19:20
per capita striking it might be bigger a
19:23
sequel to such a massive global hit like
19:26
star wars
19:27
it's pretty much guaranteed to
19:28
disappoint let's skip it
19:30
watch coal miner's daughter now we'll
19:33
miss out on lando
19:35
after perhaps the greatest propaganda
19:37
victory in galactic history the
19:38
rebellion has managed to recruit almost
19:41
50 people
19:42
now the empire has sent out drones all
19:44
over the place
19:45
luke is riding a taunton native to hoth
19:48
how did this snow planet develop life
19:51
how did the cabinets in my student
19:53
apartment develop life
19:55
we'll never know then he gets kidnapped
19:58
on the hoth rebel base they found out
20:00
luke has not called home
20:02
he's a teenager it's what they do han
20:04
still decides to look for him
20:06
don't go outside your taunton will die
20:08
then i'll see you in hell
20:10
that was a bit rude every day with this
20:12
guy
20:13
enough i can't die without you knowing
20:15
how much i hate you
20:17
now we find out who kidnapped luke hello
20:20
i'm disney cannon darth plagueis twice
20:22
let's lightsaber battle
20:26
luke wins but now he's still getting
20:28
killed by the russians
20:29
ben luke you must go to the dagobah
20:32
system where master yoda pretends to
20:35
live
20:35
he actually lives on kanto bite as a
20:37
dice champion uses the force to cheat
20:40
home if this was released today everyone
20:42
would be like
20:44
hans gonna become a jedi they smell so
20:46
bad
20:47
swedes would eat it lurk is fine though
20:50
leia calls
20:51
han a nerf herder as an insult
20:54
this shows her classism nerf herders
20:58
are pillars of galactic society fact
21:01
palpy would never insult heroes
21:04
it gets worse hello luke
21:07
through divorce i'm speaking to you i am
21:10
master yo
21:12
hello there how's it going master yo
21:15
look it's new grandfather what oh
21:19
one of the imperial drones has spotted a
21:21
giant shield generator
21:23
this guy says let's ignore it vader
21:26
doesn't ignore him
21:27
and piet gets to be admiral he has a
21:30
really nice face
21:31
i trust him i think if they showed him
21:34
as the face of the empire
21:36
they would guess a lot of supporters
21:38
empire invades hoth this is awesome i
21:40
love battlefront 2.
21:42
dumb rebels fighting outside on a winter
21:44
planet instead of a nice
21:46
warm walker this brings us to the
21:49
questions
21:49
are atats good military vehicles
21:53
hell yeah if i saw a tank outside my
21:56
window i'd be like
21:57
oh no there's a tank outside of my
22:00
window
22:00
if i saw one of this i'd be like oh no
22:03
we are fighting on the wrong side but
22:06
why don't they have guns on the side
22:08
um you seem to be forgetting that the
22:11
empire
22:12
did not plan on having any enemies luke
22:14
can still come from below and slice a
22:17
hole
22:17
that's that's why the kaminoans designed
22:20
these so close to the ground
22:21
for when order 66 would happen cannon
22:24
the empire eventually swarms them but
22:27
all the main characters make it out
22:29
luke is going to the dagobah system and
22:31
the millennium falcon
22:32
has stopped now it has a bad motivator
22:36
did the internal self-help coach get
22:38
arrested for fraud so they are clearly
22:40
dead now
22:41
ok three star destroyers having problem
22:44
taking down
22:45
one ship not meant for combat i am
22:48
making a prediction the empire
22:50
might fall they escape into an asteroid
22:52
field c3po says
22:54
the awesomeness getting an asteroid
22:56
field is 3700 to 1.
22:58
well hold on now the numbers are most
23:02
likely skewed as it's only drunk people
23:04
and idiots traveling into asteroid
23:06
fields
23:07
destroying the sample size in space
23:10
luke is coming up on the planet dagobah
23:12
you know so far
23:14
in the films we haven't shown luke
23:17
landing i wonder if he's good at it now
23:20
he doesn't have a ship hey
23:22
it's that guy it's the same species as
23:26
man yoda and r2 were bros
23:30
last time they were here what's happened
23:32
behind the scenes
23:33
yoshikiri master yushik yardle
23:36
why would a jedi be in this swamp not
23:39
shrooms
23:40
meanwhile the empire is getting paid to
23:44
slowly blow up
23:45
rocks your tax money at work ladies and
23:48
gentlemen
23:48
so our heroes are hanging out inside an
23:51
asteroid and
23:52
han starts getting really creepy cree
23:55
williams john john john williams what
23:58
are you doing
23:59
this was supposed to be a creepy scene
24:01
your music has made romantic
24:02
vader gets an urgent call from his
24:04
master lord vader my fourth apprentice
24:08
what is thy bidding forth
24:12
who is what is i beating my master well
24:14
fun you should ask
24:15
we have a new enemy luke skywalker son
24:19
of anakin skywalker
24:20
so i don't know throw pocket sound at
24:22
him we could
24:24
turn him to the dark side do you not
24:26
know the rule of two
24:27
established by darth bane vader you are
24:30
not true star wars fan
24:31
but the inquisitor are you debating star
24:33
wars lore with the emperor
24:35
on jagaba hmm luke you want to watch the
24:38
star wars christmas special
24:40
absolutely not no patience yes
24:44
yoda when you think about it no great
24:47
jedi has
24:48
any patience yoda still agrees to train
24:51
luke he lives in a swamp what else is
24:54
there to do
24:55
now he's riding around laughing at all
24:57
the haters that told him to get
24:59
waterproof
25:00
shoes most yoda is the dark side
25:02
stronger
25:03
yet really because they keep saying
25:05
teacher i am
25:06
if you disagree with me fail you i will
25:09
what's in there
25:11
don't go in there and absolutely do not
25:13
bring your lightsaber
25:14
i'm going to go in there and i'm going
25:15
to bring my lightsaber
25:17
luke enters a place so twisted it has
25:20
earth animals like normal snakes what
25:23
he encounters vader but it's his
25:26
character model
25:27
inside vader so the entire sequence is
25:30
lagging what was that
25:32
gas pockets leaking why i told you not
25:34
to bring lightsaber
25:36
blow up it could on vader's ship they
25:38
have hired some bounty hunters like 10
25:41
of them to search
25:42
the entire galaxy croissant has a
25:45
population of
25:46
1 trillion although i love how piet goes
25:48
we don't need her
25:49
kind and this guy says yes sir like he
25:52
didn't even hear what piet said
25:54
but he could tell from the tone that he
25:56
was supposed to agree
25:57
there will be a substantial reward for
26:00
finding harrison ford
26:02
like really substantial we are the
26:03
government it's not our money
26:05
that's good getting used to money store
26:07
efficiency
26:08
though the falcon is just about to die
26:10
so they won't have to pay out the reward
26:12
but han has an idea hmm we could
26:15
outmaneuver three
26:16
maybe we can defeat one swoof track them
26:20
their ships no longer appear on our
26:22
scopes no ship that small has a cloaking
26:25
device
26:26
captain perhaps they are using something
26:28
else
26:29
oh i don't like where this is going
26:30
perhaps they are using nordvpn
26:33
i believe our scopes would still be able
26:35
to track them probably not with
26:37
nordvpn's next generation of encryption
26:40
don't be ridiculous they are using 70s
26:43
computers
26:44
well with nordvpn you can also get
26:46
privacy on the go with mobile
26:48
what's a mobile you now get a huge
26:51
discount
26:52
and a free month if you click the link
26:54
in the top of the description and use
26:55
code's killian experience
26:57
killian the ancient sith lord with a
27:00
risk-free 30-day money-back guarantee
27:02
nordvpn i took this sponsorship for that
27:05
scene exclusively
27:06
the gang escapes the empire by
27:08
pretending to be snoke
27:10
but they can only travel at sub-light
27:12
speed in space
27:14
but the smooth riding makes han think of
27:17
the smoothest guy in the galaxy
27:19
in louisiana luke has lost almost
27:22
all hope yoda this is pointless ever
27:25
since the disney takeover the force was
27:28
nerfed into light pressure
27:30
do not underestimate the cannon force
27:35
wait wrong song hmm pull down star
27:37
destroyers i totally could
27:39
then the force pulls one of those
27:41
absolute classic
27:42
dead friends prank look please stay
27:46
because something's dark side it sucks
27:49
for yoda that he has to be
27:50
wise all the time he can't just say
27:53
vader will slap you like i slapped
27:55
sauerman
27:56
look i don't want to lose you like i
27:57
lost vader but i will come back to life
28:00
go to mustafar and whoop a farm boy try
28:02
me old man i'm leaving
28:04
cloud city a really lazy name for a fat
28:07
gas platform here we meet an alien
28:10
species that evolved from cognac and
28:12
cigars
28:12
called the calrissians han chewie i'm
28:15
intending to betray you
28:17
ah lando i don't care if you don't want
28:20
attention from an evil empire the best
28:22
way to do so is to hide their money or
28:24
sell them steel
28:25
you can also betray your friends but
28:28
first c-3po needs to be destroyed so
28:30
that anakin doesn't meet him yes
28:32
george thought this far ahead he's a
28:35
genius lando
28:36
invites them to an unforgettable lungian
28:39
meatballs
28:40
in a glass jar that's the most dramatic
28:43
thing about this
28:44
second most dramatic thing vader is here
28:46
and boba
28:47
was standing for dramatic effect sabhan
28:50
is to be frozen in carbonite
28:52
i love you like i'd love a brother not
28:55
exploring it
28:56
carbon freezing seems very dangerous
28:58
here but i guess it standardized it for
29:00
the mandalorian
29:01
i 100 thought carbonite was real until i
29:04
was maybe
29:05
15. i'm lying i looked it up while
29:07
making this now luke arrives to battle
29:10
vader
29:11
the force is with you young skywalker
29:13
but you haven't done any of the boring
29:15
stuff required to become a jedi
29:17
so many filler arcs so they fight and
29:20
vader could not care less obi-wan has
29:24
taught you well let's find out if he has
29:26
taught you well
29:27
vader lets luke push him down to see
29:29
what he'll do
29:30
and luke goes after him oh you absolute
29:34
amateur
29:34
good news lando betrays the empire and
29:37
rescues the girl
29:39
maybe the wookie luke and vader are
29:41
fighting into the giant room where most
29:43
of the windows are located
29:45
with people watching vader finally start
29:48
taking this somewhat seriously
29:50
no why sliced up my hands
29:56
how to defeat an opponent and also what
29:58
happened to your father
29:59
he told me enough he told me he was
30:01
overconfident in his abilities
30:04
no not no no look i
30:07
am your father no that's
30:10
not correct that's a misquote
30:13
search your feelings you know it's the
30:16
correct way to say it
30:18
no
30:21
oh you really are my son join me and we
30:24
will rule the galaxy
30:25
imagine how exhausting ruling the galaxy
30:28
would be
30:29
okay so you have a meeting on camino
30:31
fishing rights
30:32
also we we only caught five assassins
30:34
today a lot of people in the galaxy
30:36
there are most likely more in the
30:37
building luke would rather jump
30:39
and get sucked into this and is saved
30:41
this has got to be
30:43
designed that way i imagine a lot of
30:46
gas miners use attempts at sweet release
30:50
to escape their harsh contracts
30:53
luke is rescued and the ending is
30:54
bittersweet absolutely fantastic phil
30:57
not even close to coal miner's daughter
30:59
star wars
31:01
episode 6 creepy bears bring balance to
31:04
divorce
31:05
luke is walking around tatooine killing
31:07
womprats while he waits for more of his
31:09
friends to be captured
31:10
completely unrelated to that the empire
31:13
is gonna launch
31:14
death star xl way bigger and expensiver
31:17
palpatine is pure evil wants to crash
31:20
the empire's economy to create more
31:22
rebellious planets to
31:23
pop the film starts with vader landing
31:26
on the new
31:27
space station this weapon was supposed
31:30
to be finished on may the 4th
31:32
studies have shown that crunch isn't
31:34
more effective than 40 hours lord vader
31:36
you forget the emperor is connected to
31:39
epic games
31:41
why else did you think his message was
31:43
in fortnight
31:44
it'll be down my lord our two comedic
31:46
relief droids are walking towards
31:48
that thing it has no windows maybe it's
31:51
a server center
31:52
they are to deliver a message to jabba
31:54
the hutt
31:55
and his special effects have aged like
31:58
oh dersh cognac like even better than
32:01
fine wine
32:02
you don't know auto rudolph the fat that
32:05
i do you probably hate han with a
32:06
passion but disney thinks the old man's
32:09
got one more indian jones in him
32:11
you are super rich so as an insult i'll
32:14
give you these two used
32:15
droids jabba doesn't wanna sell that's
32:18
an eight thousand dollar sculpture
32:19
next in we find out droids have pain
32:22
receptors
32:23
maybe they started doing that after the
32:26
thing
32:26
revenge on the clankers 40 year old
32:29
effects have aged perfectly
32:31
then there's this has aged like minced
32:34
meat
32:35
next a bounty hunter walks in with a
32:37
ravenous beast
32:38
wookies aren't beasts they have nice
32:41
apartments with flat screen tvs
32:46
i want 50 000 credits for him or
32:50
we are in the middle of nowhere not
32:52
close to any pharmacy
32:53
oh i couldn't get my meds the fact that
32:56
no one
32:57
searches anyone before meeting jabba
32:59
either shows that he's really powerful
33:01
or
33:02
very delusional later that night never
33:04
battled that creature in a video game
33:06
did they just party and sleep in the
33:09
same room the palace is huge
33:11
why is there is this just a massive
33:13
aquarium for his frogs
33:14
if you capture enemy don't keep the
33:17
de-freezing controls next to the flab
33:20
who's there a nerf who needs herding
33:22
han's blind but if this was dicaprio
33:24
instead of
33:25
ford his first question would be how old
33:27
are you now
33:28
oh no it was a trap now would be a good
33:31
time to use that grenade
33:33
you saw the sword alright
33:37
next day a hooded man walks in who could
33:40
it be
33:41
he uses force choke that's a dark side
33:44
power heater sith lord
33:45
now you might be wondering why would a
33:48
slug monster want a half naked woman by
33:50
his side it's not odd at all
33:53
i prefer my pets half naked no that's
33:56
not a weird way to say it
33:57
first luke embarrasses himself and tries
33:59
to mind trick
34:00
then he tries to bolster hi
34:04
super powerful man i've been told to
34:06
respect my entire life
34:07
i'm a jedi can you release han loring
34:11
loser
34:11
or two reader would i have to ask her
34:14
after being called out like that
34:16
luke proves his point and grabs a gun
34:18
like
34:19
what was the plan suicide by pig ends up
34:22
in the rancor pit
34:23
luke is about to be a snack in the bad
34:26
way he sees an out
34:27
look for speed i will teach you i don't
34:30
want to run with you on my back
34:32
then only force jump worth it i expected
34:36
them to check my pockets i could have
34:38
brought my lightsaber
34:39
jabba's super expensive pet ah
34:42
saddest moment in the series careful
34:45
beast trainer
34:47
loss leads to the dark side
34:53
the exalted java wants you to kill them
34:55
instantly
34:56
sorry bots we can understand him ah
34:59
can't hold the droid for trying
35:00
job of the hot super yacht that he paid
35:03
an astonishing
35:05
200 000 credits for grab some prime
35:08
naboo wine
35:09
and hang out with the hottest hot models
35:12
but don't piss off the boss because you
35:15
might end up becoming the entertainment
35:17
jabba free us or die this is a walker
35:23
where's the song immediately after being
35:26
let's go
35:27
luke starts butchering jabba's soldiers
35:30
don't worry
35:30
now the number one toy seller will show
35:33
us his moves
35:34
it would take another 37 years for us to
35:36
get a badass bobas in
35:38
i like how han trusts his friend that
35:41
betrayed for him betrayed him a couple
35:43
of hours ago
35:44
it's within character this would be a
35:46
great time to run away
35:47
jabba unfortunately for him leia knows
35:50
forced
35:51
choking is a dark side use of the force
35:54
so she uses the light sideway then she
35:56
shoots a
35:57
shot and this happens seems like a
36:00
pretty big design flaw
36:02
don't worry for the insurance companies
36:04
though thanks to rona that boat was
36:06
worth like 700
36:08
meanwhile on death star 2 death harder
36:11
the emperor arrives are those all the
36:14
personnel on the death star
36:16
maybe more would be a fire hazard the
36:18
death star will be
36:19
finished in time banta podo there's a
36:23
giant hole in it
36:24
crunch really doesn't work luke is going
36:26
back to dagobah
36:28
and now yoda is randomly dying after 800
36:31
years
36:32
the fog on the igbo was actually smog
36:35
you
36:36
will only be jedi if you confront vader
36:39
uh you had like a thousand jedis before
36:41
the kiwis turned on you
36:43
not all of them had to confront the most
36:45
talented dark jedi in history
36:47
real jedi they were not why they all
36:49
died real ojs live
36:51
i can't go on alone according to disney
36:54
you love being alone
36:56
obi-wan luke you call him ben you
36:59
dingus why didn't you tell me vader was
37:02
my old paw
37:03
from my point of view vader did kill
37:05
anakin
37:06
from your point of view yes exactly the
37:09
anakin i knew would never had said
37:11
something so stupid
37:12
but vader did i can't kill my own father
37:15
ben
37:16
oh now he remembers if you're thinking
37:17
of leaving him by lava forget it
37:20
won't work also leia is your sister why
37:22
didn't you tell me
37:23
because it was weird dude time for rebel
37:26
briefing the emperor is on death star 2
37:29
the death starring now anyone can blow
37:31
it up but there's a shield around it
37:33
many bothans died to get us this
37:35
powerpoint disney de canonized bothans
37:38
but they also made zootopia pick a lane
37:42
all of the main characters are going to
37:43
destroy the shield but then the fleet
37:45
would just
37:46
die so they're gonna send kinda a main
37:48
character to help with that
37:50
team jedi arrived to the forest moon of
37:52
endor
37:53
and tried to sneak by the imperial fleet
37:55
hey
37:56
piet managed to survive an entire year
37:58
being vader's number two
38:00
hi there i'm just an old imperial eating
38:02
some bloody good crisps
38:04
please let us through vader with his
38:06
jedi focus
38:08
realizes this man does not sound like an
38:10
imperial but decides to let them through
38:13
on the moon they see some hoverbikes if
38:16
you've played battlefront yes they crash
38:18
immediately
38:19
leia gets lost hello i am girl levy with
38:23
indoor immigration
38:24
you want some food your visa has been
38:27
accepted
38:28
the others fall into an obvious trap
38:30
chewbacca flat screen tvs
38:33
slightly above their position didn't i
38:36
tell you to use the executor's exclusive
38:38
executive spa
38:39
there are rebels on end i know
38:43
you were in the prequels you know how
38:45
far i plan
38:46
things i did not plan for this he will
38:50
come to you
38:51
i have foreseen it i have also foreseen
38:53
the empire getting destroyed by
38:55
fanatical teddy bears
38:56
that has got to be a prank mission right
38:58
harrison ford is once again
39:00
tied up for religious purposes the
39:02
teddies are worshiping the god
39:04
protocol droid of evil kind but he
39:06
refuses to help his friends because
39:08
it's against his programming the real
39:11
reason
39:12
he's doing this is because they never
39:14
told him to not
39:15
serve job anymore so he just wants to
39:18
kill his master's killer
39:20
then he used his hover powers to scare
39:22
them now he's doing what i'm doing
39:24
luke is going to meet vader but first he
39:27
has to tell
39:28
leia his revelation remember your
39:30
parents
39:31
i barely remember them just this feeling
39:34
of an intense
39:35
hatred of sand leia you are actually my
39:38
sister
39:38
i've always known that's why i've looked
39:40
up the facts and the risk of a birth
39:43
defect
39:43
luke runs to vader lord veda we found
39:46
this one in the forest
39:47
okay should we move him to jail me and
39:50
him
39:51
are going to chill imagine the soldiers
39:53
seeing this they must be so confused
39:55
like
39:55
did we miss something hello anakin
39:57
skywalker
39:58
that name has no meaning to me anymore
40:01
like anyone can claim to have that name
40:03
the emperor won't turn me to the dark
40:05
side you underestimate the power
40:10
rebels are about to attack the shield
40:12
they need a distraction
40:13
the fact that a random bear can use a
40:15
speeder means that they are either very
40:17
smart
40:17
or imperial engineers are experts on
40:20
user friendliness
40:21
the rebel fleet approaches the death
40:23
star and luke is brought in front of the
40:25
emperor
40:26
i'll turn my father good your father can
40:29
never be turned from the dark side
40:31
has anyone actually tried no obi-wan
40:34
just said you are lost and grabbed his
40:36
slipper
40:38
but paddy also died that's what made you
40:41
dark
40:41
and now the kid's friends will die your
40:44
overconfidence is your weakness
40:46
telling your enemies weakness is your
40:48
weakness right so
40:50
my reason for joining was to stop her
40:52
from dying
40:53
why do i remain the paycheck i
40:56
told your friends about the shield it's
40:59
a trap
41:00
but the shield is real though well yes
41:02
why didn't you build a decoy
41:04
wow you're right my son his
41:06
overconfidence is his weakness
41:08
okay yeah the trap is triggered but more
41:09
importantly he's about to say it i'm
41:12
i'm in a good mood so i'm gonna give it
41:14
to you guys
41:16
[Music]
41:18
fantastic you know what bonus
41:22
i'm actually not done hey admiral we
41:25
have walked in on an imperial ruse
41:27
do you have any other way of saying that
41:30
this is as nice as i'll ever be you guys
41:32
this is the low point of the story
41:34
structure
41:35
the fleet is dying everyone is captured
41:38
and
41:38
luke has to watch it then our hero
41:41
emerges
41:43
hello i just want to say i am the mohab
41:46
3po
41:47
begin my jihad long live the fighters
41:51
the teddies begin the c-3po holy war
41:54
this will kill 60 billion people and
41:57
there is
41:57
nothing c3po can do to stop it they do
42:00
have a lot of engineering
42:02
these spears do be wicked smart it gets
42:05
very sad this is truly the best way to
42:08
show the horrors of war
42:10
in space the rebels are acting like
42:12
newspaper agencies
42:14
slowly dying i've got a text from the
42:16
emperor he has a practical joke that we
42:18
won't get to see but we'll be able to
42:20
imagine their faces
42:21
we the audience gets to see it though
42:23
haha death stars plugged in
42:25
that was the funniest [ __ ] i ever
42:27
thought i can die now luke is happy to
42:30
oblige but he's stopped by vader
42:32
a pop culture reference in star wars ew
42:36
then the empire loses back from the
42:37
death star did obi-wan never tell you
42:40
the story of darth plague just no no
42:50
[Music]
42:53
vader continues to fight so luke gets
42:56
even higher ground
42:57
on endor harry partners them cherries
43:00
are running but we need to follow you to
43:02
help
43:03
back in space are you actually hiding
43:06
pathetic i don't have a son but perhaps
43:10
i have a daughter so luke learns the
43:13
dark side actually is stronger
43:15
good good i'd like to offer you
43:19
an employment opportunity never i don't
43:22
want a job
43:23
then he throws away his self-defense
43:25
stick why
43:26
okay in his defense no one told him
43:29
people could shoot lightning through
43:30
their fingers
43:31
on endor boom in the space soon boom
43:35
hello there it's everyone i'm going to
43:37
convince you to save luke
43:38
and the cats and the cradle and the
43:40
silver spoon little
43:41
what's going on okay then notice how the
43:45
emperor is
43:46
overlooked it's almost like he has these
43:54
in space ah we get to see admiral
43:56
akbar's face when he shows pierre to the
43:58
real admirals
43:59
love this i hope he gets a dignified
44:02
death on the death star everyone is 10
44:04
seconds away from panic
44:06
this helmet is like the virtual boy the
44:09
headache makes me angry
44:10
it takes off vader's helm you look
44:13
nothing like natalie portman
44:14
you look nothing like hayden got me
44:16
there gotta save you
44:18
bro i just got that immortal life
44:22
let's blow this place up lando blows up
44:25
the second death star
44:26
making him the biggest hero in the
44:28
galaxy like everyone would think he
44:30
killed the emperor invader right
44:32
and he's gonna use it because he's lando
44:34
luke wasn't on that ship
44:36
i feel it you love him no
44:39
i'm just sexually attracted to him he's
44:41
my brother we all love
44:42
han's face here because we all know what
44:45
he's actually thinking about
44:47
the celebration montage is fun but also
44:50
dated and does not make any sense
44:53
the new music though is fantastic they
44:55
should redo this in 2026
44:58
when it's actually been 21 years after
45:00
revenge
45:01
and honestly hayden will not look like
45:04
this and that was the star wars trilogy
45:06
is it fantastic okay first we need to
45:10
address the obvious problem
45:12
none of these three films contain kit
45:14
fisto
45:15
so i i don't actually consider them
45:18
canon
45:19
still very good feelings i am now going
45:22
to give them
45:23
the highest praise i can give star wars
45:26
is the second greatest sci-fi trilogy
45:28
there is
45:29
some things it actually does
45:32
only slightly worse than the best sci-fi
45:34
trilogy but that sci-fi trilogy is once
45:36
again
45:37
so good i don't have to specify which
45:39
trilogy and that
45:40
is the killian experience thank you for
45:42
watching please
45:43
like and subscribe longest video i've
45:46
ever made
45:48
i am i am dead may the whatever date be
45:51
with you
